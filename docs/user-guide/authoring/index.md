# Writing presets

A MilkDrop preset is a small text file that programs a feedback loop. Each frame, the previous image is warped by a mesh of equations, darkened, and drawn over with waveforms and shapes. Then a final shader produces what you see. Get the loop right and a few dozen lines of code produce endless variation; get one detail wrong and the screen is black, or the preset refuses to load.

This section documents **how a preset actually executes**, at the level of the source code that runs it. It is built on two kinds of evidence:

- **MilkDrop 2's released source** (v2.25c), the reference implementation every preset was written against. Statements about MilkDrop cite the file and line, for example `milkdropfs.cpp:2852`.
- **This project's analysis of 9,606 real presets**: parsing every file, translating every shader, running each preset under controlled audio, and comparing predictions made from source alone against rendered frames.

Most preset guides describe what each variable is *meant* to do. This one also covers what happens at the edges: equation code split across lines, a division by zero, a texture name that starts with two letters and an underscore, a shape smaller than a pixel. Those edges decide whether a preset works.

!!! tip "Write for MilkDrop 2"
    ProjectM TV Engine follows MilkDrop 2 wherever projectM had drifted from it (see the [patch catalog](../engine/patches.md)). Writing to MilkDrop 2's rules is therefore the best way to get the same result here, in MilkDrop on Windows and in other projectM players. Where projectM still differs from MilkDrop 2, these pages say so under **Portability**.

## A first preset

This complete preset draws a ring that swells with the bass. It uses only a composite shader; the default warp keeps the previous frame.

```ini
MILKDROP_PRESET_VERSION=201
PSVERSION=2
PSVERSION_WARP=0
PSVERSION_COMP=2
[preset00]
fDecay=0.94
fGammaAdj=1
fWaveAlpha=0
zoom=1
rot=0
warp=0
comp_1=`shader_body
comp_2=`{
comp_3=`    float beat = saturate(0.85*(bass-0.8));
comp_4=`    float2 p = (uv-0.5)*float2(texsize.x/texsize.y,1.0);
comp_5=`    float radius = 0.22 + 0.18*beat;
comp_6=`    float thickness = 0.010 + 0.030*beat;
comp_7=`    float edge = abs(length(p)-radius);
comp_8=`    float core = 1.0-smoothstep(thickness,thickness+0.010,edge);
comp_9=`    float glow = exp(-edge*edge*130.0);
comp_10=`    float3 tint = lerp(float3(0.08,0.62,0.95),float3(0.65,0.90,1.0),beat);
comp_11=`    ret = float3(0.008,0.015,0.028) + core*tint + glow*float3(0.035,0.09,0.15);
comp_12=`}
```

What each part does:

- The **version lines** come first. Without `MILKDROP_PRESET_VERSION` of at least 200, the shader stages are switched off and `comp_` lines are ignored. `PSVERSION_WARP=0` keeps the classic fixed-function warp; `PSVERSION_COMP=2` enables the composite shader.
- **`warp=0`** turns off the animated sine warp, which defaults to *on*.
- **Shader lines** start with a backtick, which the parser strips. Lines are numbered from 1 without gaps; reading stops at the first missing number.
- `bass` and `texsize` come from a header that is prepended to every shader. `texsize.x/texsize.y` corrects for aspect so the ring stays round.

## A complete, modern example

The *Aurora Ownership* test presets, written for this project, use every block type: per-frame bass envelopes exported through `q` variables, textured, additive and multi-instance shapes, a dotted waveform and a spectrum ring, plus warp and composite shaders. They were designed so their behaviour could be predicted from source before rendering: the core's bass-driven size was forecast with a worst error of 0.076%. The source is in the [predictor branch](https://github.com/johnneerdael/ProjectM-TV/tree/feat/predictor-visual-loop/tools/milk-analyzer/witnesses/patch-0010-aurora); [Test and predict presets](testing.md#aurora-a-preset-designed-to-be-predicted) walks through it.
