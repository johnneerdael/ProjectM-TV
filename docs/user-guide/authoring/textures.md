# Textures

Shaders sample images through **samplers**. Declaring `sampler sampler_clouds;` and calling `tex2D(sampler_clouds, uv)` makes the engine find an image named `clouds` and bind it.

## How textures are found

- Every `sampler_<name>` **and every `texsize_<name>`** in the warp and composite code binds a texture, whether or not it is used. Comments are stripped first, so a commented-out declaration binds nothing.
- File extensions searched: `.jpg`, `.dds`, `.png`, `.tga`, `.bmp`, `.dib` (projectM adds `.jpeg`). Names are matched ignoring case.
- MilkDrop searches its `textures` folder, then the preset's own folder. projectM searches its configured texture paths.
- `texsize_<name>` gives `(width, height, 1/width, 1/height)` of that image.

On ProjectM TV, bundled presets use the 74 bundled images. A [custom pack](../custom-packs.md)'s presets look in the pack first and fall back to the bundled images. Texture names must be unique within a pack, ignoring case and extension.

Each referenced image costs width × height × 4 bytes of GPU memory, used or not. `tools/gen-preset-index.py` counts this per preset to decide which presets are memory-heavy.

## Sampler names and filtering

The first three characters after `sampler_` can select filtering and edge behaviour:

| Prefix | Filtering | Edges |
|---|---|---|
| `fw_` or `wf_` | bilinear | wrap (repeat) |
| `fc_` or `cf_` | bilinear | clamp |
| `pw_` or `wp_` | nearest (point) | wrap |
| `pc_` or `cp_` | nearest | clamp |
| none | bilinear | wrap |

So `sampler_pc_main` reads the previous frame with point sampling and clamped edges, and `sampler_fw_clouds` reads `clouds` with bilinear filtering and wrapping.

!!! warning "Any two-letter prefix is stripped"
    MilkDrop removes *any* `XY_` prefix, even an unknown one, and projectM copies that rule ("Milkdrop also removes the XY_ prefix in the case nothing matches"). An image named `ab_stars.png` referenced as `sampler_ab_stars` is therefore looked up as **`stars`**. Don't give textures names with an underscore in the third position.

`sampler_state { … }` blocks after a declaration are accepted for compatibility, but **their fields are ignored**. Only the prefix selects the mode.

## Built-in textures

| Name | Contents |
|---|---|
| `main` | The previous frame (warp) or the canvas (composite) |
| `blur1`, `blur2`, `blur3` | Blurred copies, encoded: read them with `GetBlur1/2/3` |
| `noise_lq` | 256×256 random RGBA, sharp |
| `noise_lq_lite` | 32×32 random |
| `noise_mq` | 256×256, smoothed at scale 4 |
| `noise_hq` | 256×256, smoothed at scale 8 |
| `noisevol_lq` | 32×32×32 volume, for `tex3D` |
| `noisevol_hq` | 32×32×32 volume, smoothed at scale 4 |

The noise textures have MilkDrop's sizes and smoothing, but their contents are random each time the program starts. Never rely on a particular noise pattern.

## Random textures: `rand00` to `rand15`

```hlsl
sampler sampler_rand00;          // any image
sampler sampler_rand01_smalltiled; // any image whose name starts with "smalltiled"
```

`randNN` picks a random image from the texture folder. `randNN_prefix` picks one whose name starts with *prefix*. A mode prefix still applies: `sampler_pc_rand00_red` is a point-sampled, clamped image whose name starts with `red`.

How the choice is made:

1. **MilkDrop 2** picks a file at random from its `textures` folder when it compiles each shader (`PickRandomTexture`, `plugin.cpp:2840`). The prefix match ignores case. Images in the preset's own folder are not candidates. The choice is local to each shader (`plugin.cpp:2927`), so the warp and composite shaders can receive **different** images for the same slot. Within one shader, each slot may be used only once.
2. **ProjectM TV Engine** instead ties the choice to the slot for the whole preset load: the warp and composite shaders see the same image for the same slot, and the choice survives shader reloads. Within one shader, aliases with a name filter fill their slots first; across the two shaders, the first stage to claim a slot wins. This differs from MilkDrop 2. Don't rely on either behaviour if you need the same image in both shaders: use a fixed texture name instead.
3. In both, a new load of the preset makes new choices, so revisiting a preset can look different, and if no image matches a prefix, nothing is bound.

ProjectM TV chooses with the system's random device, so choices are not reproducible from a seed. The evaluator's `rand()` has no influence on them. Of the bundled presets, 192 contain random sampler names.

## Transparent images

Images with an alpha channel are uploaded with their colour **premultiplied by alpha**: each channel becomes `(rgb × alpha + 128) >> 8`, and alpha keeps its value. projectM 4.1 loaded images this way through SOIL2, and ProjectM TV keeps those bytes. A fully transparent pixel therefore samples as black, whatever colour the file stored. Do not divide by alpha to recover the colour unless you handle alpha = 0.

## Named images on custom shapes

projectM (not MilkDrop 2) accepts `shapecode_N_image=<name>` on a textured shape: the shape then shows that image instead of the previous frame. The name is a texture name without extension, resolved like a sampler. If no file matches, projectM binds a 1×1 placeholder texture, *not* the previous frame, despite a source comment suggesting otherwise. MilkDrop ignores the key, so a preset that relies on it shows the previous frame there instead. No bundled preset uses it; the *Aurora Ownership* test presets do.

## Checklist

- Keep texture names lowercase-unique, without an `XY_` third-character underscore.
- Declare a sampler once and use it. Every declaration costs memory.
- Read blur through `GetBlurN`, not raw `sampler_blurN`.
- Expect `randNN` images to differ between loads; design for any image in the folder, or use a prefix.
- Bundled presets must reference only bundled textures; CI rejects a missing or excluded image.
