# Test and predict presets

A preset can fail quietly in many ways: a shader falls back to a default, an equation block is left out, a texture is missing, or the picture is black until the music gets loud. This page covers the tools for catching those failures, from a quick static check to predicting what a preset will draw before rendering a frame.

## 1. Try it on a TV

The fastest real test is your TV:

1. Zip the preset and its textures and upload them as a [custom preset pack](../custom-packs.md). **Custom** is selected automatically.
2. Play music in a verified player and watch the preset: cold, then again after a minute of music. Feedback presets can take several seconds to build up.
3. Press **Center** to see the preset's name, and open **Advanced** to check the render size and Native trails state in Diagnostics.

### Watch the log on a TV

With developer options and ADB enabled on the TV:

```sh
adb logcat -s projectM-Native
```

| Line | Tells you |
|---|---|
| `LOAD preset='…' ms=… … weight_mb=… … programs_compiled=…` | The preset loaded, how long it took, how many shader programs were compiled, its texture memory |
| `Preset code left out (<preset>): <reason> (line N, column M)` | An equation block failed to compile and was dropped, as MilkDrop would. The rest still runs |
| `Preset load failed (<preset>): <reason>` | The file could not be parsed; the preset is skipped |
| `SKIP preset='…' reason=…` | The preset was added to this TV's skip list (unreadable, failed to load, too slow, or black twice) |
| `OUTPUT …` | Brightness range and how much of the picture changed while the preset played |

A shader that fails to translate or compile does not stop the preset: its stage silently uses projectM's default shader. If a preset looks plain or "wrong", suspect its shader first and check it against the [translation table](shaders.md#what-translates-and-what-does-not).

A preset that is skipped as *black* or *too slow* is recorded on the TV's skip list; reset it under **Advanced › Skipped presets**.

## 2. Static checks

`tools/check-presets.py` runs in CI on the bundled presets in `core/src/main/assets/presets` (it takes no path argument; to check your own presets, copy them into that folder in a checkout, and never pass `--remove` there casually, because it deletes failing presets). It reports presets that:

- **cannot react to music**: no `bass`, `mid`, `treb`, `vol` or `*_att` in any per-frame, per-pixel, wave, shape or shader code, *and* the main waveform is hidden (`fWaveAlpha` ≤ 0.01 or `wave_a = 0` in code), *and* no custom wave is enabled;
- use an **excluded texture** (images with text, logos or people);
- use a **texture that is not bundled**. A texture counts only if its sampler is declared *and* used, directly or through `#define`.

`tools/gen-preset-index.py` estimates each preset's extra memory: every referenced image at its decoded size, random slots at the largest bundled image, and a 32 MB allowance for very large shaders (over 4.2 KB or with two or more loops).

## 3. Preset Lab: render and measure

[Preset Lab](https://github.com/johnneerdael/ProjectM-TV/tree/main/tools/preset-lab) renders presets offline with a private copy of the patched engine, a synthetic clock and fixed seeds.

- `preset-lab trace <preset>` follows the preset's code statically: numbered-line rules, overwrites, conditions, persistent state and q/t transfers. It shows which outputs can depend on which audio inputs. Reachability is not response strength: a bass term can be overwritten, saturate or affect something invisible.
- `preset-lab bass-screen` renders an identical carrier signal twice, then adds bass bursts at three strengths, and measures the per-pixel difference against the control. A non-repeatable control makes the result *unknown*, not "not bass-reactive".

Desktop rendering timings do not predict TV performance.

## 4. Source analysis

The [milk-analyzer](https://github.com/johnneerdael/ProjectM-TV/tree/main/tools/milk-analyzer) tools read a preset with the engine's own parser and shader translator, without rendering:

- **Stage selection:** which warp and composite stages actually run, from the version keys. Many surprises are a shader that never runs because `MILKDROP_PRESET_VERSION` is missing, or a legacy stage requested by `PSVERSION_WARP=0`.
- **Q proofs:** conservative interval proofs of what values a q variable can take. For `martin - ludicrous speed.milk`, the analyzer proves that `q29` stays within 0…7 after initialization, frame resets and its bounded increment. It follows that a composite branch on `int(q29)%4` covers exactly four cases. A q variable that no code ever writes is proven to be exactly 0 in the shader.
- **Implicit globals:** uninitialized shader globals, which read 0 on GLES.
- **Shader lowering:** whether each shader section translates and compiles as GLSL ES 3.00.

Passing all of these means the preset will *run*; it does not certify how it will *look*.

## 5. Predicting a preset from its source

The most ambitious tool is the **source forecaster**, being developed on the [predictor branch](https://github.com/johnneerdael/ProjectM-TV/tree/feat/predictor-visual-loop/tools/milk-analyzer). It is research code and has not been merged. It reads a `.milk` file, executes its equations in MilkDrop's phase order, follows shapes, waves, warp transport, feedback and the final colour expressions mathematically, and writes down **20 observable claims** before anything is rendered: structure, motion, colour, flashing and feedback, four claims each. Only then is the preset captured with the unchanged published engine, and each claim is graded: 5 points for a match, 2.5 for a partial match, 0 for a mismatch or unknown. Numeric estimates must land within 5%.

**Results.** In a randomized audit of 100 bundled presets:

| | |
|---|---|
| Presets scoring 95 or more of 100 | **85 of 100** |
| Of the 88 the forecaster could complete | 85 scored 95+, mean **98.8** |
| Perfect scores (all 20 claims) | 71 |
| Presets it could not forecast | 12: unresolved numeric domains, mostly undefined powers (6 warp power, 1 shader `pow`), plus nonfinite warp coordinates, a division and a dot product |
| Evidence | 2,000 claims frozen before 6,000 rendered frames |

In other words: where its arithmetic is resolved, the forecaster's claims about behaviour hold for about **nine in ten** presets, from source code alone. These are behavioural claims, not pixel identity. The audit covers 60 frames at 256×144, with one audio stream, seed and GPU (an Apple M4 Pro emulator); longer runs, other music and 4K detail remain unverified, and the audit's own gate, which requires all 100 presets at 95 or more, is recorded as not passed.

### What source analysis cannot settle

The twelve unforecastable presets show where certainty ends:

- **Undefined GPU arithmetic:** `pow` of a negative base or of zero to a non-positive power, division by zero, and coordinates that become infinite or NaN. GLSL leaves the result to the driver (`TonyMilkdrop - RGB.milk`, `141 nz.milk`, `$$$ Royal - Mashup (452).milk`).
- **Random choices:** `randNN` images and noise contents come from the system's random device.
- **Future audio:** a preset that reacts to a breakdown cannot be predicted without the music.
- **Chaotic feedback:** some presets amplify tiny differences until two runs diverge.

A cautionary example: `325.milk` was predicted numerically correctly, but the written *explanation* was wrong. The q32 variable is never written, so it is 0, which removes the main feedback term, and the result clamps to black. Check the proof of which q variables are untouched before explaining an effect.

## Aurora: a preset designed to be predicted

The *Aurora Ownership* SOL and LUNA presets were written for this project to test one engine feature, and designed so that their behaviour could be forecast before rendering. They make a good template for modern presets.

```ini
MILKDROP_PRESET_VERSION=201
PSVERSION_WARP=2
PSVERSION_COMP=2
[preset00]
fDecay=.90
fGammaAdj=1
fWaveAlpha=0
warp=0
per_frame_init_1=env=0;kick=0;q8=1.0;q9=0.4;q10=0.055;q11=0.3;
per_frame_1=kick=max(.78*kick,min(1.5,max(0,(bass-.95)*1.6)));
per_frame_2=env=.92*env+.08*min(2,max(0,bass_att));
per_frame_3=q1=kick;q2=env;q3=min(1.5,max(0,mid));q4=min(1.5,max(0,treb));
per_frame_4=q5=min(1,max(0,bass-bass_att+.08)*2.4);q6=time*.65;
per_frame_5=zoom=1;rot=0;warp=0;dx=0;dy=0;decay=.90;
```

What makes it predictable:

- **Bounded envelopes.** Every audio input passes through `min`/`max`, so `kick` stays within 0…1.5 and `env` within 0…2 whatever the music does.
- **Palette in init.** `q8`–`q10` are set once in `per_frame_init`, so they are the same every frame (q resets to its post-init value).
- **Explicit motion.** `per_frame_5` sets every motion variable each frame, including `warp=0`, so nothing depends on defaults.
- **A forecastable core.** Shape 0's per-frame code is `rad=.74+.12*q1`, so the core's radius ranges from 0.74 to 0.92: a 24.3% larger diameter and 54.6% larger area at full kick. On the test audio, the computed `kick` spans 0.152871 to 1.5. The render matched the forecast with a worst relative error of **0.076%**, including exact timing of flash events.

The rest of the preset uses most block types (it has no per-pixel or wave/shape init code):

- shape 0 shows a named image, a projectM extension;
- shapes 1–2 are additive halo rings with thick outlines;
- shape 3 has 12 instances orbiting by `instance`;
- wave 0 is a 256-point dotted ring with per-point colour;
- wave 1 is a spectrum ring;
- the warp shader rotates and zooms the feedback, and clears a box under the core so stale history cannot hide a wrong texture;
- the composite adds rays, blur glow, mist and a vignette.
