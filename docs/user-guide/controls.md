# Remote controls

## While visuals are showing

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| Right, Next, Fast forward | Random preset, instant cut |
| Left, Previous, Rewind | Previous preset, instant cut |
| Up, Down, Info | Show the playing track again (needs notification access and Track info on) |
| Center, Enter, Menu | Open the settings panel |
| Back | Exit the app |

Switches from the remote are always instant cuts. Blends are used only for automatic preset changes.

## In the settings panel

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| Up / Down | Move between rows |
| Left / Right | Change the focused value |
| Center | Cycle the value, or run the row's action |
| Back | Close the panel; from **Advanced** or **Track display**, return to the main panel |
| Menu | Close the panel |

The panel hides after 10 seconds without input; every key press restarts that timer. The custom-pack upload dialog stays open until you close it.

## The main panel

When the panel opens, focus starts on the **Random** button, or on **Install** when an update is ready. From top to bottom the panel shows:

- **Preset**: the name of the playing preset.
- **Presets in rotation**: how many presets the current mood can play, and how many this TV has skipped.
- **Audio**: a live meter and status: *Listening*, *Very quiet*, *No sound* or *No access*.
- **Previous / Random / Next** buttons. *Next* follows the shuffled order; *Random* picks any preset in the mood. All three are instant cuts.
- **Auto change**, **Preset mood** and **Preset duration**, then **Track display ›** and **Advanced ›**.
- A status line with the current frame rate and render size (for example *30.0 fps · 4K auto*).
- The engine version: *v‹version› · ProjectM TV Engine / Based on unreleased projectM 4.2 master / Upstream 4.2.0 · 6f6480746*.

Changing **Preset mood** keeps the current preset if it belongs to the new mood. Otherwise it cuts to a member. Previous-preset history restarts with the new mood.

The [settings reference](settings.md) describes every row.
