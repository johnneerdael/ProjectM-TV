ProjectM TV listens to the music app's own audio session. It never uses the microphone, stores no audio, and only goes online if you turn on auto-update.

## What makes it different

<div class="grid cards pm-two" markdown>

-   :material-check-decagram:{ .lg .middle } **Presets that work**

    ---

    Most of the fourteen engine patches restore MilkDrop 2's behaviour where projectM differs: tolerant equation loading, HLSL its compiler accepted, and Direct3D pixel rules. Each comes with before/after proof.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Patch catalog](engine/patches.md)

-   :material-monitor-screenshot:{ .lg .middle } **4K without the darkness**

    ---

    Lines, blur and texel steps keep their authored size, and feedback runs on an authored-scale canvas with sharp native geometry on top. This addresses the resolution-scaling part of projectM issue #682.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Rendering at 4K](engine/resolution.md)

-   :material-chip:{ .lg .middle } **Built for a TV box**

    ---

    Background shader compilation, resolution that follows frame rate and free memory, and blends that adapt to the GPU or CPU limit.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Frame pipeline](engine/pipeline.md)

-   :material-function-variant:{ .lg .middle } **Understood from source**

    ---

    In a research audit, predictions made from preset code alone scored 95 or more out of 100, on 20 observable claims, for 85 of 100 randomly chosen presets.

## Write presets

A source-level guide to how `.milk` presets really execute, built from MilkDrop 2's code and the analysis of thousands of real presets: [file format](authoring/milk-format.md), [frame order](authoring/execution.md), [equations](authoring/equations.md), [shaders](authoring/shaders.md), [textures](authoring/textures.md), [effects](authoring/effects.md), [testing and prediction](authoring/testing.md) and a [checklist](authoring/checklist.md) of mistakes found in real presets.
