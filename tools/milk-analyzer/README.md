# MilkDrop source analysis and predictive collections beta

The primary no-image entry point is [strict source extraction](STRICT_EXTRACTION.md):
`source_extract.py` runs equations, geometry and isolated shader-colour queries,
then `source_classify.py` scores cached evidence. It constructs no display fields
or native frames. [Source math references](SOURCE_MATH.md) explain how remaining
motion, pulses, feedback and structure data is obtained algorithmically and pin the
beta guide plus original MilkDrop2 source. Unsupported paths stay unknown while the
interpreter is expanded; they do not trigger hidden visual analysis.

This analyzer began with the inductive main-Q domain and shader selector proof
from [PR #25](https://github.com/johnneerdael/ProjectM-TV/pull/25). It now includes
an experimental numerical source forecaster and separate collection tools that
score activity using a published AAR. Parsing or lowering success alone does not
certify appearance; the forecaster's frozen visual comparisons are described below.

The [source feature contract](SOURCE_FEATURES.md) now separates strict custom-shape
trajectory evidence from optional simulated-display statistics. Forecast reports
include context-bound feature records with raw units, support and explicit unknowns;
these are physical evidence, not new mood scores or regenerated app indexes.
The palette math adds chromatically supported warm/cool balance, spatial/temporal
hue entropy and circular hue-change estimates. Simulated-field transitions retain
correlated time, direction, amplitude and area records, including small and
colour-only changes. Their sampled change rates do not establish flash cycles or
whole-program no-flash guarantees.

Source-field forecasts copy material/noise banks into private inputs before
evaluation. `materials_sha256` records the manifests and effective decoded
float32 arrays, including the procedural bank used by delegated sampling, under
`effective-texture-arrays-v1`. Mutation of a caller's bank during a callback cannot
change later frames. Different arrays supplied before a later call receive a new
identity even when file manifests are unchanged. Large banks require memory for
the private copy; no memory/performance improvement is claimed. Historical seals
retain their original manifest-based hashes and evidence scope.

An `on_frame` observer receives a private frame copy. Changes to its dictionary,
arrays or history cannot alter retained frames or make them disagree with the
descriptors already calculated. Callbacks can still write their own external
artifacts; those writes are not authenticated by the predictor.

Compatibility evidence is copied before pipeline construction; observer edits to
the caller's dictionary cannot change the recorded identity. Long source workloads
can declare `equation_timeout_seconds` in the domain (default60, finite positive,
at most3600). This bounds wall-clock equation execution, independently of the
predicted timeline. The strict CLI exposes `--equation-timeout-seconds`; an expired
deadline remains an unresolved preparation result and receives no accuracy credit.

Waveform and named-image adapters record their executable digest before invoking
the process and reject a changed digest afterward. Rebuilding those paths during
execution cannot assign the replacement binary's identity to earlier output.
Boundary checks do not detect every transient change-and-restore; keep adapters
fixed during a comparison batch.

The explicit `gles300-highp-infinity-v1` shader numeric policy carries justified
infinities through supported operations and the normalized RGB sink. Set
`shader_numeric_policy` in the forecast domain, or pass the corresponding strict
extractor CLI option. It requires GLES300 at source entry points; strict remains
the default. NaNs, unresolved signs/subnormal flushing, integer conversion,
nonfinite sampling/LOD and undefined powers stay guarded. See [source math](SOURCE_MATH.md).

## Current source target: published2.3.15

`profiles/published-core-v2.3.15.json` pins the exact published AAR, ARM64/ARMv7
libraries, classes and release-source identity. The forecaster's source49 policies
consume the engine fixes in0045–0049: explicit unnamed-shape sampling, coherent
float32 blur ranges, signed unit zoom, live waveform mode/dots/thickness/additive,
and live legacy gamma/echo/filter controls. Mode changes recreate waveform math;
invalid conversions omit waveform/echo as defined by the engine.

The equation reader's explicit IEEE tags are decoded only at modeled native
consumers. Gamma/echo-zoom clamps preserve C++ operand ordering; blur nonfinite
triplets use coherent defaults. Nonzero flag predicates include known IEEE values.
Omitted waves bypass unused controls. No generic nonfinite-to-zero policy is added.

Source CPU controls and old profiles remain separate from unchanged published-AAR
JNI qualification. A fresh2.3.15host built with the published classes/library passes
one frozen256×144constant-RGB control exactly. This is bounded linkage/readback
evidence, not all-policy GPU parity or authored-preset appearance certification.
See `fixtures/published2315-jni-qualification-2026-10-07.json`.
Source44 profiles and all sealed visual grades retain their original context.
Explicit historical policy overrides are counterfactual diagnostics, not a
claim that the new renderer executes those old policies. Native4K/detail paths
remain outside the source model's supported viewport.

The data-only controls can run without a device using prepared source49 adapters:

```sh
MILK_TEST_2315_BINARIES=/absolute/path/to/source49/adapters \
python -m pytest tools/milk-analyzer/test_core2315_semantics.py tools/milk-analyzer/test_core2315_wave.py -q
```

## Cached source mood/profile mappings

`source_classify.py` scores a cached source feature record without executing a
preset or consuming a native frame. It implements the explicit initial activity,
smoothness, warm/cold and psychedelic mappings plus editable music/audience
profiles. Missing inputs produce intervals and reduce preference support; Chill
requires matching-domain full-preset bound declarations for smooth/no-flash
constraints. Simulated-field evidence requires `--allow-simulated` and remains
labeled mode B. Partial shape geometry is not silently substituted for complete
preset motion, so many current records still abstain from activity assignment.

These are assumed research mappings, not calibrated correctness percentages or
updated app collections. Read [the scoring contract](SOURCE_SCORING.md) for exact
input names, formulas, defaults, command examples and remaining extraction work.

## Four initialization cases

`martin - ludicrous speed.milk` initializes `index4` with native `rand(12)` and
updates it through a bounded Boolean increment and signed remainder. The main-Q
proof includes initialization, frame resets and persistent custom locals, proving
post-frame q29 in 0..7. Float32 narrowing and signed-int conversion establish
`int(q29)%4` in 0..3. Equality branches use immutable expression identity;
missing cases, negative/nonfinite/overflow inputs, changed recurrences, shared
register effects and local shadows cannot borrow the proof. Runtime scalar/grid
guards retain its premise even when the result folds to a constant.

The other three presets are `Serge + martin - crystal palace tunnel003.milk`
(`mus`), `martin - mandelbox explorer - wreck diver nz+ liquititty.milk`
(`dist_c`) and `martin - organic light.milk` (`uv3`). The Microsoft legacy compiler
reflects these globals as external constants with NULL defaults. Previously they
became uninitialized ordinary GLSL globals. Patch 0040 preserves uninitialized
scalar/vector float globals as uniform inputs and uses the existing initialized
per-invocation copies when shaders write them. Mixed comma declarations preserve
individual storage classes. Locals, static/const declarations, initialized globals,
arrays and matrices retain their previous handling.

The versioned `projectmtv-implicit-extern-zero-v1` target policy models GLES link-time
zero initialization for unbound implicit inputs. An explicit binding supplied when
lowering or evaluating a scalar/grid field overrides that default, including different
values for different grid lanes. The policy is enabled only for declarations carrying the native
implicit-uniform marker, in a reader stamped for the new engine. `strict-v1` keeps
external inputs symbolic. It never initializes a local just because its name matches.

Initialization diagnostics retain source parsing, equation-domain proof, shader
lowering and offline compatibility checks. They are separate from the full pipeline
forecaster below. No image or device result is inferred from parsing alone.

This policy defines current core behavior. It does not claim equivalence to old
D3D9 device-register history, nor does NULL legacy reflection prove a zero value.
Authored presets and assignment order are unchanged. Before/after visual differences
for previously undefined values cannot be interpreted as appearance regressions
without a specified input policy.

## Build and validate

Initialize recursive submodules. Apply the committed projectM patch series through
an Android build or the native test runner before building source adapters. Build
host regressions using the normal repository prerequisites:

```sh
bash core/src/test/native/run_native_tests.sh
```

The Preset Lab CI job reuses its prepared engine and archive and builds eight
source adapters for reader, translator, audio, wave, image, noise, composite and
shader-random inputs. It then runs:

```sh
python -m pytest tools/milk-analyzer -q
```

For a retained host engine build, configure adapters explicitly:

```sh
cmake -S tools/milk-analyzer -B build/milk-analyzer/native \
  -DENGINE_SOURCE=/absolute/path/to/patched/projectm \
  -DENGINE_BUILD=/absolute/path/to/host/build \
  -DENGINE_IDENTITY_FILE=/absolute/path/to/build-identity.json \
  -DSANITIZERS=OFF
cmake --build build/milk-analyzer/native -j 4
```

Match `SANITIZERS` to the linked archive. The identity JSON records pinned commit,
patch digest and instrumentation scope. Native reader fixtures retain raw and
assembled equation trees separately and stamp the selected loading policy. Prepared
historical adapters cannot certify the new target policy. Historical source
fixtures and live current adapters have separate policies and evidence identities.

The native tests exercise actual parser generation, default and nonzero input values,
copy reset across invocations, local/static/initialized controls and preset hashes
checked each time the tests run. Offline translator tests require `glslangValidator`.
Numerical source tests require NumPy and pytest from the existing
`tools/preset-lab/requirements.lock`. No app runtime dependency is added.

## Predictive collections beta

The current app uses All (default), Chill1–30, Normal25–75 and Intense70–100.
`beta_score.py` executes the standard published ProjectM-TV:core AAR through its
JNI interface on a task-owned Android emulator. `beta_export.py` verifies complete
source-bound results, preserves master memory weights and publishes the three
indexes. This is numerical activity-based prediction, not a claim of source-only
visual accuracy. The [Pages article](../../docs/user-guide/predictive-collections.md)
describes the formulas, relative ranking and limitations.

The initial run uses the pinned standard2.3.3AAR in
`profiles/published-core-v2.3.3.json`. Before a new run, verify the latest published
release and update the explicit pin if needed; never label another AAR flavour as
capped. Do not edit a live run's scorer, descriptor, model, input or runtime files.
A changed artifact creates a new run identity; old rows cannot be silently reused.

Install the dependencies from `tools/preset-lab/requirements.lock`. An ARM64 API34
emulator, adb, Android SDK34/build-tools36.1.0, NDK27.3.13750724 and JDK21 prepare the
runner. No user recordings or raw frames are committed.

Prepare a new runtime directory (for example `build/predictive-beta/runtime`):
extract `classes.jar` and `jni/arm64-v8a/libprojectmtv.so` from the exact standard
AAR. Compile the helper against that AAR's classes and Android34:

```sh
javac -source 8 -target 8 -cp ANDROID_SDK/platforms/android-34/android.jar:RUNTIME/classes.jar -d RUNTIME/java tools/milk-analyzer/CoreBackendRunner.java
ANDROID_SDK/build-tools/36.1.0/d8 --min-api 34 --lib ANDROID_SDK/platforms/android-34/android.jar --output RUNTIME RUNTIME/classes.jar RUNTIME/java/nl/neerdael/projectm/analysis/CoreBackendRunner.class
python tools/milk-analyzer/java_runtime.py --aar EXACT_CORE.aar --runtime RUNTIME --dex RUNTIME/classes.dex --d8-jar ANDROID_SDK/build-tools/36.1.0/lib/d8.jar --android-jar ANDROID_SDK/platforms/android-34/android.jar --min-api 34 --helper RUNTIME/java/nl/neerdael/projectm/analysis/CoreBackendRunner.class
ANDROID_SDK/ndk/27.3.13750724/toolchains/llvm/prebuilt/darwin-x86_64/bin/aarch64-linux-android34-clang++ -shared -fPIC -O2 tools/milk-analyzer/core_backend_clock.cpp -o RUNTIME/libbackendclock.so
```

Replace `ANDROID_SDK` and `RUNTIME` with actual paths; use the NDK's `linux-x86_64`
prebuilt directory on Linux; `EXACT_CORE.aar` is the supplied published AAR.
The proof command records compiler/platform/helper hashes in `runtime-java.json`
and independently reconstructs DEX from that AAR's `classes.jar`. It fails if the
runtime DEX differs. Retain every helper `.class` used by D8 and pass each through
`--helper`; do not reuse a proof from another build. D8 34.0.0 failed to process
the 2.3.15 Java classes locally; 36.1.0 completed the verified reconstruction.
Both numerical runner CLIs snapshot local AAR/DEX/native/clock/PCM inputs before
verification, provenance or device access. Compiler inputs are copied before
reconstruction too, so later edits to original paths cannot change deployed bytes.
Historical runs without this proof retain their original evidence scope.
Scorer source hashes are frozen against import-time hashes before preflight and
checked again before provenance/device steps and before each result is saved.
Changed source aborts rather than attaching new disk hashes to loaded old code;
start a fresh process after any checkout or edit. Model JSON is read once, and its
hash describes exactly those consumed bytes even if the original path changes.
Different compiler output has a different recorded
helper hash. The Java runner calls the published JNI API, selects one preset via
an asset-index overlay, and keeps the AAR's original preset and texture content.
The clock helper interposes only core-origin realtime/monotonic calls, calls
`srand(12345)`, and streams top-left RGB bytes with a bounded header. Native
`random_device` shader/noise/image choices remain production inputs.

Generate the fixed mono float32 reference using NumPy, then keep it immutable:

```python
import numpy as np
from pathlib import Path
sample=np.arange(420*1470,dtype=np.float64)
t=sample/44100
quiet=.04*np.sin(2*np.pi*220*t)+.02*np.sin(2*np.pi*440*t)
melody=.12*np.sin(2*np.pi*220*t)+.07*np.sin(2*np.pi*880*t)+.04*np.sin(2*np.pi*3200*t)
phase=(t*2.3)%1
kick=.5*np.exp(-phase*30)*np.sin(2*np.pi*55*t)
pcm=np.where(t<5,quiet,np.where(t<9,melody,melody+kick))
Path('build/predictive-beta/input.f32').write_bytes(pcm.astype('<f4').tobytes())
```

Launch a separate owned emulator. Record its actual PID, serial, AVD name and
launch command in `owner.json`; the scorer verifies the live process and AVD before
every preset. Its `pid`, `serial` and `avd` fields must refer to that owned instance.
Never use another task's device, running process or result folder. The initial run
owns emulator5592; this is a historical task identifier, not permission to reuse it.

```sh
python tools/milk-analyzer/beta_score.py --aar build/predictive-beta/core.aar --runtime build/predictive-beta/runtime --pcm build/predictive-beta/input.f32 --owner build/predictive-beta/owner.json --device emulator-5592 --remote /data/local/tmp/projectmtv-predictive-beta-20261005 --output build/predictive-beta/scores
```

Use `--limit 5` for a pilot. Reuse the same arguments to continue a matching run;
use `--retry-unscored --only-preset "EXACT PRESET.milk"` to repair a diagnosed case before continuing. The batch now stops at its first failed measurement and refuses to continue past unresolved failures. A 120-second timeout
is a failed measurement, not evidence that an effect is calm. Original315 language
coverage and this full numerical run are different checks; the other agent's saved
baseline stays read-only.

When every source-bound row is scored:

```sh
python tools/milk-analyzer/beta_export.py --run build/predictive-beta/scores --aar build/predictive-beta/core.aar --bundle core/src/main/assets/preset-genres
python tools/milk-analyzer/beta_export.py --check --bundle core/src/main/assets/preset-genres
python -m pytest tools/milk-analyzer -q
```

The final command needs the prepared source adapters described above. The new beta
unit tests do not launch devices. CI checks the committed bundle's source, weights,
model hashes, ranks, exact overlapping memberships and checksums. Parsing success,
compile success and these checks do not certify mood or appearance accuracy.


The diagnostic-only repair preserves the exact original scorer in
`profiles/scorers/beta-score-v1.py.txt`. Previously completed records retain their
original evidence identity. `evidence-contexts.json` declares the original and
repaired producers: all render/audio/model/runtime inputs must match, the archived
source hash is pinned, and the numerical program AST must remain unchanged outside
main's resume bookkeeping and measurement diagnostic cleanup. Changed numerical
code or inputs cannot reuse those records. The bundle retains each row's producer
identity and the exact source file for each context.

Diagnostic collection is best effort and its errors are separate from the primary
measurement. For example, no `.skip` file is normally created when the engine's
skip count is zero; failure to pull that optional file does not make a completed
native measurement unscored.


### Direct-delta calibration repair

The current `audience-model-direct-delta-v2.json` is a fresh nonnegative interval
fit on the actual 30-Hz direct brightness and 10-Hz native motion vectors, using the
unchanged original eight user judgments. The old `audience-model-v1.json` expected
motion-compensated brightness and is retained solely to validate historical
producer activity. Both original scorer versions are archived; retained measurement
files are not rewritten. The exporter recalculates activity with the new model,
stores original activity separately and pins a distinct `derived_scoring` identity.

Calibration inputs, original feedback, exact preset hashes and measurement
identities are in `profiles/direct-delta-calibration/`. Feedback was on core2.2.2
under mostly unspecified music/device conditions, with a tentative sample1 and
possible darkness defect. This transferred-label beta fit is not perceptual
certification: held-out base-model diagnostics match4/8strict bands and6/8within
five points. Final corpus ranks are a separate relative transform.

Reproduce the fit offline (not required for normal export/verification):

```sh
python -m pip install -r tools/milk-analyzer/requirements-calibration.txt
python tools/milk-analyzer/fit_activity_model.py
```

The timeout callback always kills its local streaming child in a `finally` block,
even if remote ADB cleanup fails. Its diagnostic errors are retained and the timer
is joined before the outcome is saved. Timeout still halts the batch.


Retries now select only existing unresolved records. Naming an unmeasured or
already scored preset with `--retry-unscored` is rejected; without `--only-preset`,
the retry invocation repairs only selected unresolved cases. Run the normal command
again after those failures are resolved to continue unmeasured cases. The required
metadata pull has a 15-second timeout and records an unscored outcome if it fails,
even after the renderer has exited. Ownership/remote setup and overlay transfers
are bounded separately; runtime artifact pushes have a 180-second limit.


## Full visual prediction loop (in progress)

The mathematical source forecaster predicts structure, motion, colour, flashing
and feedback before comparison with the published core AAR. Fresh comparisons
now target canonical Native core 2.3.8, whose downloaded AAR is byte-identical to
2.3.7; saved 2.3.4/2.3.5/2.3.7 rows keep their identities.
The current goal progresses through three-preset batches with all three at95+
behavioural-rubric grades, then ten-preset batches with all ten at95+, followed
by a randomized100-preset final audit. Complete each batch under an unchanged
model before repairing its gaps. Each run uses60frames at30fps. This supersedes
the earlier100-for-three gate and ten-case80/100 streak; none is a calibrated probability.
Unknown or contradicted claims earn no credit. Generation is outside this work.

Fresh Round006 passes the three-preset stage: MoltenWheel, demonizer and
glassworms flip each score95/100 with no critical mismatch. All60 claims and
source predictions were frozen before the first published-AAR capture, and the
model/inputs stayed unchanged through the batch. Motion and colour point
estimates receive partial credit; these are operational behaviour grades, not
pixel-perfect or calibrated accuracy percentages. The next gate is ten fresh
presets with all ten at95+, before the randomized100-preset audit. Evidence:
`fixtures/visual-loop-round006-2026-10-06.json`.

The first ten-case Round007 does not pass: six reach95, two source-domain
attempts remain unresolved, one black-output case lacks motion/history coverage,
and one retained-history prediction is materially too bright. Original records
are preserved. Repair these gaps and improve the declared60-frame stimulus before
another ten-case gate; the randomized100-case audit remains pending. Evidence:
`fixtures/visual-loop-round007-2026-10-06.json`.

Round 001 scored 97.5, 100 and 90. It did not meet the gate. Its frozen compact
fixture preserves predictions, identities, measurements and misses. Earlier
Tripgnosis trajectory errors were repaired by correcting custom-wave point counts
and PCM resampling; that diagnostic retest earns no fresh-batch credit.

Source CPU profiles distinguish the 41 patches matching core 2.3.4, the
42 patches matching core 2.3.5 and the 43 patches matching core 2.3.7.
Prepare adapters separately for each identity;
the existing `build/milk-analyzer/native` adapters retain their historical
41-patch identity. Source adapters are not the Android AAR. The driver previously
used equation seed 12345. Production projectM-eval initializes MT19937 per thread
with `0x4141f00d`; calling C `srand` does not seed that generator.

For a fresh evaluator thread, declare `equation_seed` as `0x4141f00d` and select
the matching `equation_rng_policy` in the forecast domain:

| Policy | Required patch-series SHA-256 |
|---|---|
| `projectmtv-core-2.3.4-cold-thread-v1` | `d21d4e3d9725178c000fd6f7ea5cd331389fb1100b70fce51341ece65d3fd818` |
| `projectmtv-core-2.3.5-cold-thread-v1` | `d73c955a26380a502516e6ba3a18baf753851244de4de2e5a3083930766a539a` |
| `projectmtv-core-2.3.7-cold-thread-v1` | `d70f5b5ec3f3c0b4da764cb824153f142b88e17e27c2e9e71d2b481c19998c7d` |

All three require upstream commit `e0b0a967f0ffd7d332106c366668ed271718472b`.
The forecaster rejects another seed or a mismatched release/patch identity;
changing a policy name does not migrate historical rows to another engine.
Other explicitly supplied seeds retain the `declared-seed-v1` policy. Provenance
records the seed and cold-thread assumption; this is not a preset-switch reset
policy and does not fix shader/noise/image randomness.

For these three verified patched source identities, an omitted
`main_binding_policy` now resolves to `projectmtv-core-2.2.6-v1`: unqualified
`sampler_main` occupies unit0, where the warp pass applies the preset wrap mode;
qualified aliases retain their own filtering/wrap settings. The historical sorted
order could instead put `sampler_fc_main` on unit0 and leave unqualified main
wrapping, despite `bTexWrap=0`. Unknown source identities retain the historical
default; an explicit historical policy remains available for labeled diagnostics.
Provenance records the effective binding policy without modifying the requested
domain or its hash. Diagnostic retests retain their original grades.

The verified43-patch source defaults to
`projectmtv-core-2.3.8-shape-state-v1`, modeling the published core's sampler-state
leak. The warp draw clears sampler0. Only a delayed blur update subsequently
binds clamp/linear before the first unnamed main-textured shape. Without that
update the first main shape uses repeat/nearest texture settings. Each textured
draw clears sampler0 afterward; later unnamed instances use the framebuffer
texture's repeat/nearest settings. Named-image descriptors keep their own modes.
Actual blur requests come from active custom source, including sampler/texsize
references and native GetBlur substring checks, with comments removed. Draw
ordinals keep separate instances from sharing the wrong callback.

This is compatibility with an observed engine defect, not an intended universal
MilkDrop rule. Unknown source identities retain `legacy-repeat-linear-v1`; the
current policy rejects an unverified source identity. Provenance records the
effective policy and native required blur level. Update this contract after an
engine fix; do not apply the old leak to another AAR identity. The separate
Downloads handoff identifies `widest swing.milk` as runtime-confirmed and3,940
statically configured main-textured sources as investigation candidates, not
certified defects across the library.

A separately frozen 60-frame native control through the unchanged 2.3.4 AAR
matched all predicted RGB8 values exactly for three equation random draws per
frame. An independent NumPy MT19937 control also checks draw order across 33 shape
instances and 60 frames. These bounded controls do not certify all authored
visuals. Correcting only the seed reduced case 012 mean RGB error from 0.15987 to
0.10398 against its saved reference; contour timing still differs.

The 2.3.4 and 2.3.5 JNI hosts enable patch 0024 quad lines with a 1024x768
reference at the 256x144 test size. The older source drawing path used
canonical GL lines. Declare `line_rendering_profile` as
`projectmtv-gles-quad-lines-v1` for the patched GLES hard-edge wave/shape-outline
path: it models strip-end padding, miter joins and GLES pixel-border tie bias.
This profile accepts the three exact engine identities above and currently
requires a viewport no larger than the reference area;
high-resolution scaling, antialiasing and motion-vector quads are not certified.
The original `canonical-gl-lines-v1` remains available for historical contexts.

Core 2.3.5 adds authored feedback/native trail detail in patch 0042. JNI leaves
that layer inactive through height 1330; above it, Native trails also use a
1280x720 line reference. The source model does not implement that feedback path
or scaled lines. Every forecast with the 2.3.5 engine identity rejects viewports
above the 1024x768 reference area or height 1330, even with the canonical line
profile or a declared lab equation seed. Accepting the low-resolution identity
does not establish 4K support or appearance accuracy. The first 2.3.5 batch,
slots 019–021, scored 97.5/17.5/65 under the frozen behavioural rubric. The
original 2.3.4 slots 016–018 were withdrawn before captures.

With the exact 2.3.5 or 2.3.7 engine and the GLES quad profile, built-in dotted waves use
one centered 2-pixel point at or below the reference area. The earlier model
used four offset 1-pixel copies. The canonical profile retains those historical
copies; quad-dot requests with other engine identities or larger viewports are
rejected. Correcting only this draw path makes Hyperspace's second frame match
the saved native white frame exactly and reduces its 60-frame RGB8 mean error
from 2.951 to 0.416. This is diagnostic evidence, not fresh acceptance credit.

Separate PCM cadence from the equation `fps` input. In the declared cold JNI
test host, the engine starts with target FPS 35. The JNI tracker updates it after
the 30th rendered image at simulated time 1 second. Supply equation FPS 35 for
images 1–30 and 30 for images 31–60 while retaining the 30 Hz PCM arrays and
timestamps. A separately frozen `q1=fps/256` control through the unchanged AAR
matches the expected red bytes 35 then 30 on every pixel. This timeline describes
that exact host lifecycle, not arbitrary app startup or device frame rates.
Correcting only this input in the unchanged frozen model restores `187`'s red
fan; its 60-frame RGB8 mean error falls from 1.130 to 0.0083, with maximum 2.
See `fixtures/visual-loop-dot-fps-repair-2026-10-06.json`. Point snapping and
motion-vector quad rasterization remain separate gaps.

Declare `point_subpixel_bits` separately when a renderer context establishes
point-centre snapping. The Apple M4 Pro API34 emulator controls uniquely match
nearest 1/256-pixel snapping (`8`), despite reporting `GL_SUBPIXEL_BITS=4`.
Five candidate grids were frozen before the finer native capture; only the
8-bit prediction matched all pixels. The setting propagates to custom and
built-in wave point coverage; omitting it retains unsnapped canonical coverage.
Integers 0–16 are accepted. `np.rint` halfway ties remain a declared mathematical
policy, with native exact-halfway cases unverified. Do not assume the same grid
on other GPUs. The case019 diagnostic mean RGB8 error improves from 1.023 to
0.748; remaining fine feedback differences are preserved. See
`fixtures/visual-loop-point-grid-repair-2026-10-06.json`.

Core 2.3.7 adds patch0043 to preserve authored geometry in Native trails. The
separate 43-patch archive and adapters retain their actual identities; unchanged
standalone image/random/composite adapters are reused only after source/header
byte-equality checks. Newly captured 2.3.7 FPS and hue controls complete 60 frames
with Standard trails inactive at144p: FPS matches exactly; hue differs by at most
one RGB8 level. The hue control retains its original source-math identity and
does not substitute for a full 43-adapter forecast. Larger viewports/detail paths
remain rejected; Native4K's authored-preservation purpose does not establish our
predictor's 4K accuracy. See `fixtures/visual-loop-release237-migration-2026-10-06.json`.

The CI-only 2.3.8 release changes no engine, JNI or patch source and publishes
the same complete AAR bytes. Its reference uses the existing verified 43-patch
engine policy, source backend and runtime namespace, with the new release label
recorded for fresh rows. Do not relabel earlier controls. The download and source
equivalence are in `fixtures/visual-loop-release238-equivalence-2026-10-06.json`.

Framebuffer conversion preserves the represented float32 shader value when
scaling to UNORM8. A float32 intermediate product can incorrectly round a value
just above a half-byte boundary back onto the boundary. Scaling in float64
avoids that extra rounding, then returns normalized float32 storage. An
independently frozen 60-frame AAR control matches all pixels under this rule;
the previous rule misses one channel in 30 frames. Native exact-halfway tie
handling and other dithering states remain unverified. This correction does not
by itself certify feedback-sensitive presets. See
`fixtures/visual-loop-unorm-conversion-repair-2026-10-06.json`.

Drawn geometry accepts a separate `triangle_subpixel_bits` input (integer4–16;
omission preserves canonical coverage). Snapped vertices remain in window-pixel
space for triangle coverage and interpolation; colors and UV attributes are not
snapped. This propagates through shapes, borders, center darkening and quad waves.
The declared Apple emulator's8-bit input makes case023's first pass-through
feedback frame match every native pixel. Later feedback still diverges; this is
not complete preset certification or a universalGPU rule. See
`fixtures/visual-loop-triangle-grid-repair-2026-10-06.json`.

A frozen curved-line native control agrees within one RGB8 level over 60 frames.
The full case 012 diagnostic now matches coherent flash counts (one brightening,
zero darkening) and predicts peak brightness jump 0.8194 versus native 0.8207.
Later feedback details still differ; this is not fresh-batch credit or general
pixel equivalence. The exact native preset repeats identically across the two
recorded loads, ruling out reference variability in that bounded comparison.

Wave forecasts now retain projected native clip coordinates through quad-line
expansion. Early rounding near normalized screen 0.5 could change tiny-segment
lengths and coverage; the shader expands those coordinates before viewport
translation. On the case013 diagnostic, mean luma improves from 0.1188 to 0.1406
(native 0.1414), and tracked motion from 0.1305 to 0.1755 (native 0.1764). An
isolated waveform's pixel positions differing by more than one RGB8 level drop
from70to14across60frames. The original batch grade is preserved; these controls
do not establish driver-wide pixel identity or earn fresh-case credit.

CPU wave/composite adapters now include the actual pinned `RenderContext.hpp`
instead of duplicating its structure. Its time field is float32; an earlier stub
used double and the long-clock tests mistakenly validated that stub. Hue math now
preserves native float intermediates. Adapter output records the header hash and
time width, and forecasts require the prepared float32 adapter. Focused controls
pass66tests plus19subtests; this is not a full imported-suite result. The corrected
type does not resolve randomized hue choices on its own.

For source/reference math comparisons, the user selected matching declared
random inputs. The opt-in Android test-host in `core_random_inputs.cpp` supplies
a uint32 entropy seed and a separate MT19937 lower-31-bit stream per core thread.
Only callers from `PROJECTMTV_TEST_CORE_PATH` are affected; production core is
unchanged. Enable it with `PROJECTMTV_TEST_RANDOM_SEED` and an owned
`PROJECTMTV_TEST_RANDOM_LOG`. Without the seed variable, supplied inputs are off.
The source shader-random bridge accepts `declared-mt19937-u31-v1`; its default
still uses host C rand. A supplied stream is a test input, not a claim about
production libc randomness or scheduling. The background worker's reseeding
cannot disturb this test profile's renderer stream.

The composite CPU bridge can generate hue offsets from `entropy_seed` using the
copied native initializer, or accept explicit `hue_offsets`; provide one. Seeded
hue and high-quality noise controls agree with the unchanged AAR within one RGB8
level over60frames. Noise seeds use the native system-clock microsecond count's
low32bits at the first draw, when resize recreates the textures. Both earlier
wrong seed attempts are retained. The matching-input case015 diagnostic has mean
RGB8 error0.563; it does not replace its failed original prediction or count as a
fresh perfect match.82focused tests plus19subtests pass under prepared adapters.
Random external image selection still requires a matching asset/binding context.

The current plan is `docs/plans/2026-10-05-predictor-visual-loop.md`. Raw artifacts
remain in ignored `build/visual-loop/`. The broader imported suite needs prepared
historical adapter profiles and is not reported passing. No whole-corpus accuracy
claim or change to the shipped beta collections follows from this research.

### Fixed-warp power domains

The handwritten warp vertex shader uses nested GLSL `pow` for zoom and zoomexp.
A negative base is undefined even with an integer exponent; zero with a nonpositive
exponent is also undefined ([Khronos ES reference](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KhronosGroup/OpenGL-Refpages/main/es3.0/pow.xml)).
The source predictor rejects those domains instead of adopting NumPy signed powers.
The observed zero-stretch profile does not authorize a negative-power interpretation.
CASE037's original feedback mismatch remains a failed prediction; a source-only
corner-sampling diagnostic isolates the warp path, but target-GLES power/UV behaviour
requires independent controls before any numerical runtime policy is added.

Round008 source preparation uses the next unchanged ten queue positions038–047
with a frozen stronger two-second stimulus: nine complete60-frame forecasts and
one unresolved complex-reciprocal singularity. This is source computation only,
with no native accuracy scores or TEN-gate credit. The exact centre coordinate
differs under the existing optional composite raster model; target varying controls
are required before selecting that policy. Published2.3.8 and candidate44 adapter
identities remain separate while PR41's publication is blocked by its render test.

### Published-JNI audio ingress

Match the published runner's audio conversion before CPU PCM/FFT evaluation:
float32 `value*128+128`, Java rounding toward positive infinity at half ties,
clamp0..255, then native unsigned-byte input. `core_backend.jni_pcm_inputs` produces
the exactly equivalent float PCM; `validate_jni_audio_context` rejects a report
whose PCM hash does not match that converted input. Keep transport and effective
source PCM hashes separate. Do not use raw float audio reports for this JNI host.

Round008 was aborted after its first native capture because the stronger stimulus
was evaluated before this conversion. No cases039–047 were captured, no accuracy
scores were credited, and original predictions/seals remain unchanged. An input-only
CASE038 diagnostic reduced mean RGB8 error27.4085→0.1525 against the existing capture.
It earns no fresh gate credit. Independent Java execution matched88200samples and
1541boundary controls. New predictions and claim freezes must use the corrected input
contract before comparisons resume.

The isolated published2.3.8 composite-UV control now matches the explicit eight-bit
raster prediction at every RGB8 channel: centre140/151/96 versus analytical128/128/96.
The control uses the production mesh on the owned Apple M4 Pro API34 emulator at
256×144. Under that explicit setting, the original CASE041 complex-reciprocal shader
completes60source frames without a fabricated epsilon or NaN rule. No full authored
native appearance is credited yet. Other viewport/GPU/4K contexts remain unverified;
the portable default is unchanged. See `fixtures/composite-uv-raster-control-2026-10-06.json`.

Future batches use the user's approved5% allowance for numerical estimates:
`abs(observed-predicted) <= .05*abs(predicted)`. Zero predictions require zero.
Geometry, trajectories, critical feedback mismatch, flash counts and event timing
remain strict. Freeze this rule with all claims before any new native reference;
earlier grades and the92.5 diagnostic remain unchanged.

Round009 clears the TEN gate: cases039–048 score100/100/100/95/100/100/100/100/100/100,
with no critical mismatch or unknown. All200claims were frozen before600native
frames;308result files were sealed. Case042 lost five points for speed estimates
outside5%, despite matched geometry; late046 and sparse041/042pixel residuals remain.
These are operational behavioural grades, not pixel identity or calibrated probabilities.
The randomized100-preset audit and final reviewed integration remain required.

The source44 profile is bound separately to published2.3.10 (commitfa18cbab):
`projectmtv-core-2.3.10-cold-thread-v1`, patch digest545ca48a. Main binding and shape
sampler ownership retain the43-patch contract; higher-resolution/native-detail paths
remain rejected. Actual source44 forecasting reproduces the fixed literal control,
and two unchanged-AAR one-frame controls match frozen RGB exactly. CPU source44
PCM/FFT arrays match all60 source43 frames; artifact identities remain distinct.
The100-preset audit uses the latest published AAR and its matching source adapters.

### Reproducible historical and current tests

Historical parser/translation controls use90 source-bound snapshots and14 policy
source files in `fixtures/historical-profiles`, with explicit profile markers.
Request, payload, engine/archive/header and source-file hashes are checked; original
adapter digests are retained as provenance and checked for format length. Actual
installed GLSL compilation and current native EEL execution remain live. Snapshots
do not establish historical GPU appearance. Regeneration requires exact archived
adapters; normal tests no longer need another worktree's build/cache directories.
Current paired adapters are selected with `MILK_TEST_CURRENT_BINARIES`; validator
selection uses `MILK_GLSLANG_VALIDATOR` or PATH.

The task-owned `build/preset-lab-venv` replaces the old external environment. Its
NumPy/OpenCV/pytest versions are unchanged; the editable package now points to this
worktree's `tools/preset-lab`. The complete matched-source44 suite passes1010tests
and67subtests with no skips. Coverage CLI progress goes to stderr, keeping JSON
stdout parseable. The explicit44 built-in dot identity guard preserves the existing
single2px GLES point contract and rejects unknown source identities/large viewports.

### Randomized100 audit checkpoint

The unchanged queue049–148 has100 successful published2.3.11 JNI captures,
6000native frames. All2000claims and source results were frozen before the first
reference. Source forecasting completed88cases;12 numerical-domain gaps remain
included with zero credit. The first50cases are graded:43 at95+ and7 source
unknowns. Remaining grades are pending; this is not a100-case pass claim.
See `fixtures/visual-loop-round010-checkpoint-2026-10-06.json`.

Published2.3.11 is byte-identical to the qualified2.3.10 AAR. The frozen manifest's
`runtime.artifact_sha256` map accidentally retained older2.3.8 library/transport/
runner hashes. Preserve that original metadata as evidence of the discrepancy;
it is not the current runtime identity. The capture script independently checked
current host/guest published library, AAR, DEX and helper hashes before each
capture. The supplementary fixture records actual artifact identities and this
limitation; per-capture successful assertions did not save their hash stdout.
Every capture's source/overlay, frame count, pixel hash and pre-capture freeze was
independently rechecked. No predictions or model were changed during the audit.

### Final randomized100 audit

The sealed audit is complete:85/100 cases score95+,12 source arithmetic-domain
gaps retain0credit,107/138score90, and125scores65with a critical trajectory
mismatch. Mean86.95including unknowns;98.8068among88completed predictions.
The125preliminary85grade is preserved alongside a stricter separate adjudication.
71scores of100indicate agreement with the20frozen observables, not pixel identity.
Case121's fine-grainRGB8MAE48.88remains a documented fidelity gap despite its
matching larger forms and aggregate claims. Three black/nearblack cases earn
no credit for unobservable motion.

All100original queue entries,2000pre-capture claims,5336source frames and6000native
frames remain in the evidence. Root verified2939sealed files, row sums and the
recreated random permutation. The final report prioritizes12domain gaps,125's
geometry/history,11computed speed misses and five computed flash-miss cases.
No new AAR defect is established by those misses. Existing separate engineering
handoffs remain under Downloads; the released literal repair passes its exactRGB
control. See `fixtures/visual-loop-round010-2026-10-06.json` and
[the final audit report](../../docs/plans/2026-10-06-predictor-random100-audit.md).
The intermediate checkpoint remains historical; final reviewed integration is pending.

## Shader literal identity

Current source adapters stamp `float_literal_policy` as `float32-roundtrip-v1` and the production formatter’s `float_formatter_sha256`.
The reader exports `renderer_literal` through that formatter, and lowering uses its
reparsed value. Rebuilding against patch 0044 therefore models the new renderer
rather than retaining the old six-digit emission. Historical adapters and archived
measurement fixtures keep their original identities; do not relabel them.

`test_float_literals.py` checks 99 authored AST witnesses in 95 hash-verified presets,
the adjacent-to-one coefficient and scale, both GLSL targets, and rejection of an
overflowed literal even when the shader declares `inf`. Native tests additionally
exercise finite float32 boundaries, signed zero, randomized bits, locale and a
one-frame full-engine render. These are source/controlled execution checks, not a
visual forecast for every affected preset.


Post-audit code review repaired multiplication semantics: native bare scalar/vector
`*` calls `mult0` with binary32 input/result conversion, including integer operands;
compound `*=` uses ordinary GLSL arithmetic and does not inherit its zero guard.
Preserve effective helper return types through parent arithmetic/comparisons;
explicit declarations still cast to their authored type. New scalar/grid controls
cover values above2^24and unresolved logarithms. The sealed audit remains on its
original model revision; these repairs do not retroactively change its grades.


Review asset verification reuses Preset Lab's strict index reader. Install the
package in the same environment (`python -m pip install -e tools/preset-lab`).
It compares ordered preset names and memory weights with the published AAR's
`assets/presets.idx`, in addition to scores, memberships and checksums. A changed
weight or extra column fails verification even when its checksum is updated.
Empty groups remain supported. This concerns the review exporter; the shipped
beta bundle and native category checks remain separate.

Frame-cache-aware random ledgers must match each scene's declared render-input
frame and ordinary draw state (`feedback_detail_alpha=-1`). Detail passes are
unmodeled and rejected; a matching timestamp alone cannot select a different
frame's cached uniforms. Preserve historical ledgers without cache metadata under
their existing limited policy. The frozen100-preset audit declared correct frame
and ordinary-draw inputs; these new guards do not rerate its existing evidence.


The older `core_corpus.py` ARMv7 runner now verifies its local native library
against `jni/armeabi-v7a/libprojectmtv.so` inside the supplied AAR before creating
a run identity or contacting a device. Stale libraries, a library from another ABI,
or an AAR missing that ABI fail immediately. Its run identity records the verified
native hash; deployed copies are still checked separately. The ARM64 beta scorer
already performs its corresponding AAR/library check. This does not replace
checking Java/JNI compatibility, clock/audio settings or actual rendering.


Review verification recomputes the canonical core-corpus identity from recorded
model, code, runner, runtime, profile and device facts. The top-level, metadata and
per-preset score identities must agree. Older review exports without complete
provenance/per-row identity must be re-exported from a validated original run;
this does not require new captures. Identity consistency is not a signature or
proof that declared measurements are authentic. Score arithmetic still needs the
separate run audit. This verification remains usable without SciPy.

Forecasts record the source module hash map before evaluation, compare it with
the import snapshot, and recheck it at completion. Edits/rebuild checkouts affecting
Python model files invalidate the forecast instead of attributing old code to new
file hashes. Run fresh Python processes after code changes; importing against an
already stale dependency cache is unsupported. Start/end checks are not an OS-level
immutable snapshot and do not claim to detect a file changed and restored between
checks. Batch freezes and isolated worktrees remain required.

Current published core through source44 deliberately remains the prediction target:
built-in waveform mode/dot/thick/additive and legacy gamma/echo/filter consumers
read static PresetState despite live EEL counterparts. Switching only the predictor
to those live values would mismatch the AAR. MilkDrop3 consumes live controls, so
these native compatibility gaps have separate engineering handoffs in Downloads;
a future native repair needs a versioned predictor policy and fresh controls.


The current acceptance requirement is all100randomized presets at95or higher.
The historical85/100audit failed that gate; completing its captures/report did not
complete the goal. The12unresolved predictions and three scored misses remain
explicit repair targets. Preserve old grades and label repeat comparisons as
repair controls; no replacements, imputed unknowns or loosened rubric qualify.
Nine warp diagnostics identify six negative-zoom cases and three centre-vertex
zero-zoom cases. PR47 repairs only signed negative zoom with unit zoom exponent;
other domains require separate interpretation/target controls.


The forecaster now checks whether transformed warpUV actually reaches a custom
shader's result/effects before making its numerical failure fatal. A shader using
only the packed originalUV components may omit the unread transform after a
specific spatial-domain error, while the source equations still execute in order.
Loops/unknown graphs, consumedXY/conditions and active motion vectors remain
conservative. Unknown profiles cannot bypass validation. OmittedUV is reported as
unknown with no query-displacement credit; only the unread internal input receives
a finite placeholder for field evaluation. No observed native image supplies it.

Exactcase124now completes60source frames instead of failing atframe0. This is a
repair control, not a95+visual pass or fresh blinded audit. Original grades remain
unchanged; source/newpublished-AAR comparison is still required. See
`fixtures/unused-warp-uv-repair124-2026-10-06.json`.


Equation scene execution resolves the reader path before constructing its request,
checks the original binary digest against the caller’s expected identity when supplied,
and rechecks that digest immediately before and after execution. A rebuild during
request preparation or execution rejects the result instead of crediting another
producer. The scene reports the original verified `reader_sha256`; a relative
reader path cannot execute a same-named PATH shadow. Do not rebuild pinned adapters
during active forecasts. This guards producer attribution, not visual accuracy.
Forecast and strict-feature callers supply their verified parser digest. Standalone
historical equation diagnostics may intentionally use a newer evaluator; their
reported execution digest stays separate from the archived source parser identity.


Declared Android noise inputs now require the explicit
`android-libcxx-microseconds-v1` clock period. For a GLES300
`core-thread-inputs-v1` contract, the supplied noise bank seed must equal the
low 32 bits of the **active bank’s generation** clock in microseconds.
The JNI test runner creates an initial bank at surface creation, then replaces
it on the first preset draw when setting texture search paths. That active bank
uses the first-frame clock. Do not mistake the first logged bank for the bank
actually sampled by the preset. Missing units, unsupported
platforms, invalid timestamps and mismatched seeds reject the forecast. Unpaired
source experiments keep their explicitly supplied noise seed without an Android
matching-input claim. Always verify the observed initialization seed before
crediting a paired comparison. Invalidate comparison credit only after establishing a mismatch in the active
bank; matching descriptors alone does not validate shared inputs.

Source parsing and random-ledger generation now execute private snapshots of the
exact adapter bytes hashed at entry. Corpus parsing also snapshots each preset
and rejects a reader that differs from the declared corpus digest before writing
a cache row. A workspace rebuild cannot substitute different bytes under an old
cache or producer identity; Android random execution uploads the same private
adapter snapshot. These are attribution guards, not additional appearance evidence.


Procedural seed export has two explicit policies. The default
`lab-subsystem-seed-v1` preserves historical lab output. The opt-in
`production-clock-seed-v1` supplies the raw production clock seed by reversing
the verified private archive’s subsystem101 and size/zoom XORs separately for
each texture. Unknown instrumentation cannot select this policy. The manifest
records the policy and each effective `generator_seed`; paired-clock forecasts
reject lab-policy banks. A direct unchanged2.3.15 AAR noise_lq control matched
the repaired source samples within1RGB8 at256×144. This bounded control does not
certify arbitrary drivers, complete presets or fresh randomized accuracy.
Build new adapters in a separate directory; do not overwrite frozen binaries.
`MILK_NATIVE_NOISE_BINARY` selects the prepared noise adapter for its tests.


The exact published2.3.16/50-patch source has a separate cold-thread RNG
identity and shares the49-patch scalar/drawing policies. Patch0050 retains
per-preset texture-manager ownership; it does not change those equations or
shader math. This compatibility is limited to declared cold bundled loads;
custom-pack precedence, transitions between packs and texture-cache resets need
their own source/context modeling. Unknown source digests remain rejected.
Runtime qualification uses the unchanged full2.3.16 AAR/classes through JNI,
not the CPU archive. Its frozen one-frame noise control matches within1RGB8;
this is not a fresh randomized or high-resolution appearance certificate.

Review collection verification requires the producer’s native/AAR digest and
reproduced-DEX binding record. It cross-checks the runtime library, executed and
reconstructed DEX hashes, and embedded AAR native library/classes. Legacy records
with only independent runtime hashes cannot be marked verified. This validates
recorded producer proofs and AAR membership; the review asset verifier does not
rerun D8 without the producer’s toolchain/helper artifacts. Preserve legacy
records and revalidate their original runtime before producing a new bound export.

Temporal colour descriptions must state their exact phases.
`prediction_windows.validate_colour_claim` checks a declared RGB/area predicate
over every claimed source-predicted frame; it rejects a persistent-window claim
if any intervening frame fails. `describe_colour_presence` formats only verified
frame IDs. This numeric helper does not parse arbitrary prose, inspect native
references, or establish structure/motion accuracy. A closely matching numerical
forecast cannot silently repair an overbroad frozen description.

Whole-window motion speed has an explicit coverage policy.
`coverage-gated-window-v2` requires at least three supported transitions and
support on at least half the window before publishing median/p95 speed.
Sparse supported-subset values remain diagnostic, with counts and fractions;
unavailable speed stays null. This is an estimator reporting rule, not proof of
stationary geometry or no visible movement. The default legacy-supported-subset
policy preserves archived semantics. Forecast domains may select the new policy
through `motion_window_policy`; use the same policy for paired comparisons and
freeze it before capture. Keep old grades unchanged and state uncertainty before
drafting numerical movement claims.


Thirty-frame feedback diagnostics remain separate from acceptance scores.
The EoS glowsticks control retains the authored blur and gradient resource
references while displaying raw feedback. Its source and native pixel sequences
are identical to the earlier resource-removed control; first-frame error is at
most 1 RGB8 level, followed by feedback divergence. An amplified identity-UV control
also exposes unresolved low-bit differences; grid8 alone and blanket half
precision are not established repairs. These controls do not demonstrate an AAR
bug or change the original 95 score. Exact hashes and numerical outcomes are in
`fixtures/feedback-precision-resource-controls-2026-10-07.json`.


`SourcePipeline` binds `texsize_main` from its owned feedback dimensions in
both shader stages, matching the native main descriptor within the supported
resolution domain. No material bank is required for this built-in texture size,
and caller values cannot replace it. Unknown external/blur size inputs and
high-resolution shader-canvas overrides retain their existing guards. See
`fixtures/main-texture-size-repair-2026-10-07.json` for the regression and
published-AAR control identities. The fix grants no credit to archived forecasts.


The opt-in `texture_sampling_profile` value
`apple-m4pro-gles-unorm8-fixed8-fraction4-v1` models observed two-dimensional
UNORM8 sampling on the Android Emulator OpenGL ES Translator for Apple M4 Pro.
Coordinate fractions round to eight bits; filtered raw byte values round to
four fractional bits, with exact half-way values rounding upward in both steps.
Fresh four-corner tests matched all 32 frozen packed values; additional controls
established both tie rules. Isolated shader tests are joined to eight samples
from the unchanged full published 2.3.16 AAR; they are not a replacement AAR.

Forecasts must declare GLES300 and quantized feedback to select this profile.
It applies consistently to main, blur, named/procedural 2D textures, textured
shapes and legacy echo reads. Floating-point textures and 3D volume lookups are
not qualified by this profile and remain rejected when it is selected. Portable
and historical SwiftShader defaults retain their existing meanings. Pipeline
history records the effective main and texture sampling profiles. This observed
driver model is not a portable language rule or a high-resolution certificate.

The original EoS glowsticks 30-frame result remains 95. A learning repair retest
with this sampler model and grid8 warp interpolation independently scored 100:
median motion error 2.83%, p95 error 1.03%, and exact flash-event timing matched.
Mean RGB error fell from 0.01697 to 0.00073; isolated pixel differences remain.
The repair earns no fresh randomized-run credit. See
`fixtures/apple-gles-sampler-learning-2026-10-07.json` for numerical evidence.


The separate `apple-m4pro-gles-unorm8-fixed8-fraction4-volume-v1`
texture sampling profile retains the same 2D rules and adds observed UNORM8 3D
filtering in raw upload `[z,y,x]` order. Round coordinate fractions on all three
axes to eight bits. Form fixed16 X/Z coefficient pairs, round each lower-Y
coefficient upward at half-way values, and derive its upper-Y complement by
subtraction. Sum byte values with those integer coefficients, then apply final
fixed4 half-up rounding. Do not round intermediate XY texture planes. Unequal-volume tests matched all 32 frozen
packed values; 48 Z-axis tie checks and four unchanged published-AAR volume-noise
checks also matched exactly. This is an explicit Apple emulator profile; it does
not establish float/sRGB, mipmapped or other-driver parity. The original 2D-only
profile continues to reject volumes. See
`fixtures/apple-gles-volume-sampler-learning-2026-10-07.json`.


Volume coefficient qualification resolved the review finding. The former
float32 prototype and exact full trilinear weights both missed observed boundary
cases. The conserving lower-Y coefficient rule matches all 128 discriminating
packed observations, including 32 fresh observations from an axis-swapped cube.
X- and Z-oriented alternatives fail those fresh controls. No per-coordinate
exceptions are used. These are observed-driver numerical controls, not fresh
randomized preset scores. The volume programs' default/highp labels represent
repeated highp-sampler3D runs, not an independent precision comparison.


Large-angle warp rotation has a separate current-AAR compatibility finding.
On the recorded Apple emulator, vertex sin/cos both return zero at +/-10000000,
including highp; MilkDrop 2 instead computes CPU sinf/cosf for its emitted float
rotation. A diagnostic-only reduced-angle preset variant restores agreement with
the original source mathematics, but does not certify the unchanged authored
preset or repair its failed grade. The source model retains mathematical
rotation; a production range-reduction fix and published-AAR retest are pending.
Five exact-literal source candidates are recorded separately from the one
confirmed reproduction. See
`fixtures/native-large-angle-warp-compatibility-2026-10-07.json`.

Source geometry reports also expose `component_translation`: signed centroid
displacement summed over intervals with matching component and vertex identity.
Positive X is right and positive Y is down in normalized top-origin screen
coordinates. Missing components and topology changes never contribute a bridging
displacement; budget failure withholds the partial result. This equal-vertex
summary describes evaluated geometry, not visible movement or monotonic motion.
Its nonzero direction has no perceptual threshold. Use it to check directional
prose against source trajectories before freezing future descriptions; do not
infer left/right from unsigned speed. A contradictory archived description keeps
its failed grade even when its predicted fields agree with the renderer.

The second frozen ten-preset/30-frame batch against published 2.3.16 scored
100, 100, 100, 65, 97.5, 100, 100, 92.5, 100, 100 after independent review.
Seven presets met every frozen clause; the batch fails the all-100 requirement.
The large-angle preset loses geometry/trajectory and numerical/event credit;
two others miss median optical-flow estimates, and one of those also has a
wrong-direction prose claim. Original grades and sources remain unchanged.
Separate engineering handoffs retain each issue; diagnostic variants receive
no randomized credit. See `fixtures/random30-batch002-results-2026-10-07.json`.

The CPU audio adapter accepts an opt-in request `clock_policy` of
`projectmtv-jni-rounded-nanoseconds30-v1` for the declared 30 Hz JNI test host.
It matches Java `Math.round((frame+1)*1e9/30)` and uses the resulting elapsed
time for both frame timestamps and loudness-decay updates. Each frame records
`clock_nanoseconds`; the report records `render_clock_policy`. Other cadences
and unknown policies are rejected. The default `ideal-frame-fractions-v1`
retains historical/general audio behavior. Rebuild into a separate adapter
directory and set `MILK_NATIVE_CLOCK_AUDIO_BINARY` for the new clock tests;
do not replace archived binaries or mix their audio/source archive identities.

Against a separate numerical-input-only control using the unchanged full
published 2.3.16 AAR, the corrected source producer matches all 270 float32
time/audio-band values across 30 frames. This fixes an input mismatch, not the
remaining visual precision gaps: a learning retest still misses median motion
by 7.94%. Its original grade and source remain unchanged. Preset progress also
differs from the archived zero placeholder and requires a matching sampled
lifetime context; the clock fix does not establish progress parity. See
`fixtures/jni-rounded-clock-audio-2026-10-07.json`.

The subsequent `preset_progress_policy` value
`projectmtv-core-2.3.16-cold-jni-v1` models the ready, single-preset cold JNI
setup for at most 30 mono frames. It requires the pinned 2.3.16 source identity,
rounded 30 Hz clock and an explicit uint32 `entropy_seed`. Two initialization
duration draws and the first authored hard-load draw each construct a fresh
normal distribution; cached companion values are discarded. Mean duration is
30 seconds, modifier is 1 second, and the preset starts at elapsed time zero.
Progress uses the sampled third duration, with the native one-second minimum
duration and maximum progress of one. Equation FPS is 35 for this bounded
window; physical PCM/render cadence remains 30 Hz.

The source producer is qualified only with libc++ version 200100 and records
`duration_distribution_model=libcxx-200100-fresh-normal-v1`. Other standard
libraries/versions are rejected for this opt-in policy: their normal-distribution
sequences are not assumed identical. Warm loads, retries, smoothing, changed
settings and longer windows require another declared context. Two numerical-only
full-AAR controls, including a second seed frozen before capture, match all
720 float32 clock/progress/FPS/frame/audio-band values. This resolves the progress
input gap in this context, not the remaining raster/feedback precision misses.
Default historical reports retain `explicit-zero-placeholder-v1`; zero is a
supplied placeholder, not proof of native progress. See
`fixtures/cold-jni-progress-context-2026-10-07.json`.

Custom-wave smoothing has an explicit `custom_wave_smoothing_profile` option,
`float32-fma-first-v1`, for the qualified GLES 2.3.16 source context. It models
observed ARM64 contraction of the four-position interpolation: round the second
coefficient's product, fuse the first coefficient into it, then fuse the third
and fourth before the final half-scale. True float32 `fmaf` is required; an
unavailable intrinsic is rejected. The separate-operation float32 default keeps
historical behavior. Domain and custom-wave reports record the selection.

With native unsmoothed positions supplied solely to isolate this arithmetic,
the fused formula matches all 2,044 observed smoothed coordinate components.
Those controls do not establish every evaluated point, raster coverage or visible
trajectory. Learning retests still miss median motion by 7.94% and 17.98%; their
original grades remain unchanged and no fresh random credit is awarded. See
`fixtures/custom-wave-fma-smoothing-2026-10-07.json`.

The third frozen ten-preset/30-frame batch against published 2.3.16 scored
100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 95, 100, 100, 100 after independent review.
Its mean is 99.5, but it fails the all-100 requirement. The cosmic-tear preset
misses both motion estimates and retains visible fine-feedback differences;
its other frozen clauses pass at their stated scope. A raw-feedback control
matches frame one and diverges at frame two. Source inspection then identifies
an unforwarded GLES quad-line policy in the motion-vector path. A disposable
quad-path prototype improves the two errors to 2.30% and 9.60%, still a miss;
no completed repair or fresh credit is claimed. See
`fixtures/random30-batch003-results-2026-10-07.json`.

The declared GLES quad-line profile now also reaches motion-vector drawing
through the forecaster and feedback pipeline. Motion vectors use independent
flat-ended quads with the same declared tie bias and triangle subpixel grid;
raw clip coordinates are retained before top-origin conversion. Historical
canonical line coverage remains the default. Pipeline history records the
motion line profile and grid, and vectors still use the previous frame's UV map.
This repairs the missing routing, not every endpoint/raster calculation.

The integrated cosmic-tear learning retest still has 2.30% median-motion and
9.60% p95 error. Its original 95 grade stays unchanged. Half-float motion-UV
texture filtering is a separate unresolved numerical boundary: isolated tests
reject exact bilinear interpolation, while simple fixed8/half-rounding models
still miss some cases. No unqualified half-sampler rule is added or credited.

Source geometry reports first, last and window bounds for each physical
component separately. Extents use normalized top-origin coordinates before
visibility or viewport clipping; outside geometry is retained. Budget failure
withholds partial bounds. Opposing components must not be labelled central
because their average centre is 0.5. These custom-shape bounds do not locate
every shader or feedback feature: mirrored/remapped output needs separate
source evidence. Wrong-location archived claims retain their failed grade.

Predicted-field descriptors also retain per-frame thresholded spatial support:
top-origin 3×3 occupancy counts, support in the central half-width/half-height
rectangle, and union bounds covering occupied pixel cells. Pixel centres select
half-open regions; the maximum encoded RGB channel must reach the recorded
`value_floor`. Empty measured frames remain present with null bounds. This
source-model calculation includes shader remapping and feedback, unlike raw
custom-shape bounds. Union bounds do not identify objects or establish that an
opposed pair is central. Below-threshold output and events outside the sampled
window remain unknown. The nested descriptor uses neutral supplied-field provenance:
the caller identifies whether its input is a source prediction or native capture.
Native inspection is not an input when calculating the source-predicted report.

The fourth frozen batch scored 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 60, 95, 85, 95, 60
after independent review (mean 89.5). Unknown clauses for sparse/dark outputs
and unsupported motion retain zero credit; Type24's centre-location prose fails
despite matching predicted fields. No successful batch is credited. Existing
captures are reported, but further randomized batches are gated on fixing open
predictor issues and retesting the affected originals. Dark-preset appearance
requires deeper investigation; matching near-black output is not certification.

The optional `motion_uv_storage_profile` selects
`apple-m4pro-gles-rg16f-rtz-normal-v1` for qualified Apple M4 Pro/API34
GLES motion-map framebuffer writes. It truncates finite normal half-range
values toward zero; zero is supported, while subnormal and overflow inputs are
rejected. The default `portable-half-nearest-v1` preserves historical behavior.
Forecasting requires the pinned 2.3.16 engine and GLES context, and pipeline
history records the selection. Twenty-two saved normal framebuffer controls
match exactly. The separately declared
`apple-m4pro-gles-rg16f-rtz-finite-v1` also permits subnormals and underflow:
twelve frozen scaled-magnitude framebuffer observations match, including cases
that reject nearest rounding. Signed-zero behavior is retained by the source
conversion but is not certified by the absolute-magnitude GPU readback.
Both profiles reject nonfinite input and finite values above 65,504.
This models storage only: half-texture filtering remains an
independent unresolved boundary, and the cosmic-tear motion miss stays open.
See `fixtures/motion-uv-half-storage-2026-10-07.json`.

Further isolated half-filter controls retain mismatches even for an affine
texture varying along one axis. Equivalent local phases on 8×8 and 16×16 maps
match each other, and floating-point readback reproduces the packed results;
neither texture-size normalization nor packed output explains those misses.
Exact fixed-fraction ties and nearby nonexact coordinates differ. No exact
filter rule is accepted from these controls, and the original motion miss stays
open. Sources, frozen alternatives and observed hashes are recorded in
`fixtures/half-uv-filtering-axis-research-2026-10-07.json`.

A crossed-Y control establishes that four-product accumulation can change a
horizontal ramp's half tie even when its texels are constant along Y. Shared
exponent truncation candidates fit all 224 earlier observations, but an
independently frozen fresh discriminator rejects every candidate (best 62/64).
Nearest fetch verifies all 16 fresh uploaded values against the declared RTZ
input. No filtering implementation is credited from the near-fit; the failed
preset remains open. See `fixtures/half-uv-fresh-discriminator-2026-10-07.json`.

Identical half-exact texels sampled from RG32F follow exact bilinear arithmetic
within the packed readback precision; the disputed deficit occurs in RG16F.
Four power-of-two scales preserve all 256 observed scaled outputs exactly,
excluding fixed absolute quantization in that range. Isolated corner and paired
maps largely follow nearest-half output, but summing their already-rounded
results fails to reproduce the full map. These controls narrow the gap to the
half-format accumulation path without qualifying an exact predictor rule or
establishing a production engine defect. See
`fixtures/half-filter-format-accumulation-2026-10-07.json`.

Local half-texel perturbations retain additional mismatches near output
thresholds. They identify required small pre-final deficits in two fresh cases,
but do not establish an exact arithmetic rule. These failures are preserved in
`fixtures/half-filter-local-thresholds-2026-10-07.json`; no predictor filtering
change or repaired-preset credit follows from the diagnostic.

Published 2.3.17 contains patch 0051, which computes warp rotation sine/cosine
on the CPU after conversion of the authored result to float. The full AAR was
checksum-verified; Java classes and bundled assets are byte-identical to 2.3.16.
The original large-rotation preset completes a new 30-frame JNI retest against
its retained frozen source forecast. All five numeric checks meet the original
5% of predicted-value allowance; the original 65 grade remains historical and
the retest earns no fresh randomized credit. Exact identities, numerical results
and the independent full-claim review's current disposition are retained in
`fixtures/large-rotation-published2317-retest-2026-10-07.json`.
The isolated 51-patch source archive/adapters and exact 2.3.17 equation, live-wave
and cold-clock profiles are now integrated. Old profiles retain their original
identities; wrong-version requests are rejected. Source51 selects CPU float
rotation automatically, and records the effective policy and host producer in
provenance without changing the requested domain/hash. The historical NumPy
rotation default remains available for earlier source identities.

The CPU path calls host `sinf`/`cosf` after float32 conversion, without reduction
by a rounded 2π constant. One read-only published-AAR mesh control observes a
one-float32-step sine difference between this host and Android at rotation
10,000,000; cosine matches and the observer preserves all output bytes. The
source51 same-preset forecast still passes all five numerical checks, but this
does not certify arbitrary-angle host/Android bit parity. A stable suite passes
1,422 tests and 78 subtests. Earlier integrity failures from editing model files
during a running suite are retained; validation must run against fixed code.

The builtin-dot adapter also accepts the exact 51-patch identity, whose rotation
patch leaves this drawing contract unchanged. A real paired reader/wave-adapter
regression covers that path; other identities and unsupported viewport sizes
remain guarded. A latest-AAR Glowsticks black-warp/identity-composite control
retains the original wave equations: 19 of 30 frames match exactly, with 69
different RGB8 channel values across the run and exact median motion. This is
stage-isolation evidence, not an original-preset pass; its feedback/composite
precision miss remains open. See
`fixtures/glowsticks-draw-isolation2317-2026-10-07.json`.

A read-only latest-AAR blur observer preserves all final pixels and retains
per-pass outputs. Feeding observed horizontal blur into source vertical math
still differs in five one-byte values at the first level. A float32 half-up
output-rounding near-fit is rejected by a separately frozen RGBA8 control:
the existing represented-value conversion matches all 60 observations. Do not
change the generic quantizer from that near-fit. Blur arithmetic/varying
precision remains unresolved; see
`fixtures/glowsticks-blur-attribution2317-2026-10-07.json`.

The optional `blur_arithmetic_profile` value
`apple-m4pro-gles-vertical-blur-fma-v1` contracts the vertical weighted sum:
round the first pair's weighted product, then fuse the second pair's product
into it with float32 `fmaf`. Horizontal and subsequent edge/normalization math
retain their existing paths. The historical `separate-float32-v1` default is
unchanged. Forecasting requires GLES300 and the exact 2.3.17 source identity;
pipeline history and forecast provenance record the selection.

The observed-input vertical control matches all 6,912 float components with
this contraction order. A separately frozen random texture matches 6,476 of
6,912 components, with maximum float error 1.19e-7 and no quantized-byte misses.
Those controls establish bounded evidence, not universal float identity. The
opt-in path makes one cached ctypes `fmaf` call per output component; no speed
improvement is claimed. The original Glowsticks learning retest passes all
five numerical clauses and independent full-claim review now scores its repaired
30-frame window 100. The original 97.5 score is preserved, with zero fresh random
credit. The warm tail's down/right movement is relative to its start; its endpoint
is still left of the viewport centre, so absolute right-half placement is not
certified. Final stable validation passes 1,427 tests and 78 subtests.

The optional `shader_arithmetic_profile`
`apple-m4pro-gles-mix-nested-fma-v1` evaluates HLSL `lerp`/translated GLSL
`mix` as `fmaf(b, t, fmaf(-a, t, a))` after float32 narrowing. It is qualified
only for the declared Apple GLES/source51 context; scalar, grid, array fallback
and consumed motion-UV evaluation share it. The separate-operation default and
the shader nonfinite policy remain unchanged; fused mix requires finite inputs.
Pipeline history and forecast provenance retain the selection. The implementation
uses two ctypes calls per output component; no performance improvement is claimed.

The nested rule matches 32 initial numerical observations and all 64 independently
frozen fresh signed-input observations. A simpler weighted FMA rule was rejected
by fresh controls. These are bounded numerical controls, not universal compiler
or GPU guarantees. The mix-only original Zylot learning retest missed median motion by 19.78%;
that historical failure is preserved. Subsequent horizontal-blur diagnosis and
the combined correction below close its tested window. Mix correction alone
did not earn an original-preset pass or randomized credit.

The separate combined blur profile `apple-m4pro-gles-blur-forward-fma-v1`
adds three forward float32 FMAs to the horizontal kernel after its rounded first
weighted pair and retains the vertical contraction above. Existing separate and
vertical-only profiles preserve their horizontal arithmetic. Exact source51 and
GLES guards still apply. A freshly frozen random texture matches all 27,648
horizontal shader float components; this is bounded backend evidence, not a
universal hardware contract or a performance claim.

With the combined profile, the unchanged Zylot learning retest meets all five
numeric clauses: median error 0.0000614%, maximum error 0.00127%. Independent
full-claim review scores the repaired window 100; the archived original 92.5
remains unchanged, with zero fresh randomized credit. Triangle-body/source
geometry moves left/down, while changing halo intensity shifts the whole-field
brightness centroid upward; those measurements are distinct.
Cosmic's corresponding latest-AAR retest still misses p95 motion by 8.36%, so
half-texture filtering remains open and no new randomized batch is started.

Cosmic's exact-half midpoint control now isolates dependence on Y/cross-row
weights or accumulation: at the
same X252/256 and identical rows, Y0 chooses the upper result, while the complete
Y0..256 sweep chooses it only every 16 steps (17 points); the other 240 choose
the lower result. Lowp/highp agree and changing the constant sibling channel
from zero to one does not affect the result. These standalone sampler controls
load no AAR and earn no preset or randomized credit. The finding rejects an
X-only explanation for this control, but no general filter rule is qualified;
see `fixtures/half-filter-y-stage-attribution-2026-10-07.json`.

The experimental opt-in `motion_uv_sampling_profile=measured-gles300-vertex-half-v1`
uses a `MeasuredMotionSampler` callback for prior-UV lookups. It requires exact
source51/GLES300, finite-half storage and a matching frozen operator identity.
The portable default is unchanged. Missing/mismatched backend, invalid samples,
changed evidence or nonzero core rendered frames fails explicitly. Input maps,
queries, outputs and evidence are saved and hashed; the forecast declares
`prediction_basis=source-with-measured-operator` and retains the operator report
in provenance. This is measured GPU arithmetic, not independent hardware math.

`MotionSamplerOperator.java` is an auxiliary GLES300 vertex/transform-feedback
program loaded alongside the published core classes/library. It receives only
predictor-computed half UV maps and query coordinates. It initializes no preset,
calls no core render methods and uses rasterizer discard; no reference/display
frames enter the forecast. It is not an exposed core numerical API. Five bounded
controls match 1,420/1,420 components exactly, with core frame serial zero, including
independently frozen signed/subnormal/edge-clamp texel-centre inputs. This qualifies
the numerical operator within the recorded backend, not portable GPU behavior.
The same-preset Cosmic forecast/comparison remains pending; its original 95 and
latest 8.36% p95 miss are retained. See
`fixtures/measured-motion-operator-bound-v2-2026-10-07.json`.

Independent review found binding gaps in the initial auxiliary adapter. That
first Cosmic comparison remains an uncertified diagnostic, despite passing its
numerical clauses. The corrected adapter compares actual runtime hashes directly
to the qualified AAR/library/class/operator identity, uses a unique per-instance
remote namespace, and verifies hashes produced by Java for the input bytes it
actually consumed and the output it returned. The wrapper also verifies the
bottom-origin physical-map bytes and executor-source identity. Saved evidence
cannot change without invalidating the report. Corrected controls again match
1,420/1,420 components; a new same-preset forecast/capture is required.

Forecast domains may explicitly set `geometry_derivative_sample_budget` to a
positive integer when a dense authored scene exceeds the historical one-million
derivative limit. The selected budget is retained in the domain/hash and geometry
report. Defaults stay unchanged; exceeding the chosen budget still withholds
all partial derivative/location summaries. A sufficient budget computes the
whole declared window without discarding vertices or changing percentiles. These
are potential source geometry derivatives, not a substitute for unsupported
visible motion or certification of dark/clipped output.

Cold audio attribution is now cross-checked against original MilkDrop2.25c:
`mysound` starts at zero, early long-average decay is 0.9, and a first nonzero
band above the minimum threshold therefore has relative amplitude near ten at
30 Hz. The patched source51 Loudness recurrence retains this behavior with
elapsed-time rate adjustment. This is structural source evidence, not FFT/float
bit parity or a justification to normalize away large cold inputs. Hyperspace's
sixth-power audio term and sample06's subtractive warp can amplify that initial
state into clipping/darkness. Their visual/intention and missing-speed gates remain
open; no repaired score is credited from matching suppression alone. See
`fixtures/cold-audio-source-attribution-2026-10-07.json`.

Sample10's unchanged composite now has a numerical factor trace: sampled `reta`
can approach one, while `reta.x² * reta * ret`, colour blending and final gain
reduce the whole display below half an RGB8 step in frames1–7 and13. The maximum
pre-storage composite value across the30-frame source window is0.0307174. A
separate uninstrumented run has identical all30 display bytes, so the diagnostic
does not change the predicted output. This establishes source-model suppression,
not native/legacy appearance parity or a supported visible speed. Original60 and
unknown clauses remain. See
`fixtures/dark10-composite-factor-attribution-2026-10-07.json`.

The corrected bound-v2 Cosmic learning retest now has a written independent
assessment: all20claims and30pairs score100 under the unchanged numerical5% and
exact-event rules. Maximum numeric error is2.2076753%. All29 actual-consumed
operator bindings and the305-artifact/86-context seal verify; current geometry-
budget code changes are separated from matching historical model bytes. Original95
is retained, with zero fresh randomized/batch/streak credit. This closes only the
declared measured-operator repair window, not independent hardware-sampler math
or the other dark/clipped/indexing cases. See
`fixtures/cosmic-measured-operator-repair-2026-10-07.json`.

The unresolved SpottedBlob2 vector-index case is narrowed under savedsource51
audio/time: out-of-range accesses occur in frames1–3, with first indices9,1,7.
Frames4–30 are in range, but their feedback depends on unresolved earlier output.
Do not skip the early frames or insert black feedback to credit a complete forecast.
Legacy compiler semantics or an explicit versioned target policy remains required.
This source-domain calculation consumes no reference frames and earns no score.
See `fixtures/spotted-blob2-source51-index-domain-2026-10-07.json`.

The resumed validation target is 20 rounds of three random presets, 30 frames each,
requiring 60 consecutive scores of 100. A fresh MT19937 queue is frozen before
predictions and references; historical scores and repairs do not contribute. Any
predictor bug gates the next round. Library defects receive separate handoffs.

Published v2.3.21 uses the 4.2 master pin
`6f64807467e312034883a4389e6aa80a675458bc` with 11 retained patches, digest
`fd02c15d040ca073f7c09a0b798040c2696fa6bf2252d6ddc6c7b6ff7bcd92eb`.
Its full AAR checksum is
`941108bb16279cb77a3b4db430ef4befcfe9706abbc87afe87745d53e3424e3a`.
CPU adapters now support separate composite vertex, UV, polar and colour buffers
and native Point waveform coordinates. They extract native numerical bodies, omit
GPU uploads and hash original and adapted sources. The newer stbi decoder retains
the released multiply-alpha byte rule through the target patch. Its manifest names
the actual backend and implementation path/hash; its SOIL field is null. Historical
SOIL manifests retain the real SOIL implementation hash.

Bounded migration controls: mesh positions and UVs match exactly, with maximum
polar difference 5.96e-8; all 16 safe waveform modes match historical geometry; a
premultiplied RGBA image matches exactly. The unchanged full AAR passes 180 constant
frames exactly. Another 180 packed input frames have exact band and attenuated-band
values and at most one RGB8 level of time/frame/FPS error. Two separately frozen
30-frame progress controls match the candidate three-fresh-duration-draw startup
model exactly. These observations support a future explicit 4.2 policy, not
automatic reuse of old source guards.

Qualification controls earn zero random prediction credit. Cold progress, complete
stochastic inputs and source42 policy guards remain pending. Historical source51
guards are not relabelled as 4.2 fidelity. The historical suite passes 1,459 tests
and 78 subtests. The unpublished coordinate-fix candidate remains a different
source/AAR identity and will be integrated after publication. Evidence is in
`fixtures/core42-adapter-qualification-2026-10-07.json`.

The explicit `projectmtv-core-2.3.21-cold-jni-v1` CPU audio policy is now guarded
by the exact 4.2 commit/11-patch digest and rejects historical progress labels.
Its 30 time/frame/FPS/progress/band inputs match the bounded native context.
The new cold-thread equation RNG label keeps `0x4141f00d` separate from the
helper's C RNG seed. Evaluated native waveform controls accept this exact new
identity; broad hardware profiles remain separately guarded.

The pristine 4.2 noise bridge no longer relies on the historical instrumented
archive. It extracts native 2D/3D/cubic bodies, replacing exactly two clock reads
with a declared raw seed and recording original/adapted body hashes. It rejects
missing/lab policies and unmatched engine identities. All six banks match the
qualified raw-seed bytes; repeated and changed seed controls pass. The full AAR
noise probe and `rand_frame`/`rand_preset` ledger probes match exactly across two
30-frame repeats each. These are numerical input qualifications, not preset scores.
A simple three-frame source forecast executes with the new identity. Full suite:
1,467 tests and 78 subtests. See
`fixtures/core42-cold-input-policy-2026-10-07.json`.

Official v2.3.22 now supplies the two coordinate fixes (AAR
`c8b93297aa84e6e5c1e860b7ef136fb84deb1ef946c4f66dd1863f1bd9379d65`,
13-patch digest `3ade58a837591acde97d07a45f703d53047bbe0fc3993149bdfe0dd54298a381`).
The exact source identity selects a composite mesh without the old half-texel
UV bias and custom-shape fills/borders shifted half a destination pixel down/right
in top-origin output. Authored shape values and texture UVs, waves and global
borders stay unchanged; historical centre defaults remain available. Corrected
labels require the exact new identity. The unmodeled high-resolution exclusion
still applies to v2.3.22.

A frozen native impulse exposed an initial predictor Y-sign error: source row71
versus native row72. The repaired model matches all60 saved control frames exactly.
A fresh asymmetric control has exact support at(108,64) in all60frames, with one
RGB8 blue-level difference retained. The generic quantizer is unchanged. Native
CPU corrected mesh UVs match exactly. These are qualification/learning controls,
not random scoring credit. See
`fixtures/core2322-centre-policy-controls-2026-10-07.json`. New release stochastic
and waveform identity guards still need explicit admission before round one.

The exact v2.3.22 identity now has its own cold JNI and equation RNG labels.
Native evaluated wave and raw noise paths admit only the retained explicit
source identities. A three-frame source forecast computes under the new archive
with both corrected centre policies. The full new AAR replays the frozen startup
controls: bands, attenuation, progress, noise and both shader random vectors are
exact; packed clock/frame/FPS stays within the declared one-RGB8 bound. Prepared
integration tests pass; missing adapters/platform prerequisites explicitly skip
without granting qualification. First-round source predictions, frozen claims
and reference scores remain pending; the random streak is zero. See
`fixtures/core2322-input-policy-qualification-2026-10-07.json`.

The v2.3.22 custom-wave smoothing profile is numerically qualified at the native
pre-projection upload boundary: seven smoothed points match exactly in each of
60 diagnostic draws, with duplicated line endpoints kept explicit. The observer
intercepts only the core's EGL provider lookups, serializes its record writes and
forwards real driver calls. Failed helper attempts are retained. Observed and
unobserved pixel streams match byte-for-byte. These are numerical smoothing
controls, not appearance or randomized scoring credit. See
`fixtures/core2322-custom-wave-smoothing-2026-10-07.json`.

The first source-only round exposed native4.2 setting keys lowercased by the parser.
An exact-engine parser policy now restores case-insensitive lookup without changing
the raw payload; JSON reloads preserve that policy, and historical dictionaries
retain their prior behavior. This fixes shader-version flags and scalar settings
such as decay and wave mode. The invalid legacy-circle forecasts are archived and
ungraded. No reference frames had been captured. The same three presets recompute
with correct stages; see
`fixtures/core42-setting-key-lookup-repair-2026-10-07.json`.

Public stage, equation, waveform, warp, drawing and shader-pipeline entry points
restore this setting contract after JSON reload. Unknown explicit policy names
are rejected rather than silently using defaults. Published v2.3.23 was downloaded
and verified byte-for-byte identical to v2.3.22 (AAR SHA256
`c8b93297aa84e6e5c1e860b7ef136fb84deb1ef946c4f66dd1863f1bd9379d65`);
its engine qualification therefore uses the same byte-bound policies.
