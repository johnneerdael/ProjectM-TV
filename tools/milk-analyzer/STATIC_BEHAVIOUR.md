# Source-only behaviour and preference evidence

The experimental export now includes `analysis.visual_description.static_behaviour`.
It derives conditional component evidence from the typed program graph, without
evaluating audio/frame sequences, equations, shaders or rendered images. The patched
source reader parses the preset; compiler evidence may qualify stage selection.

## Consumer fields

| Field | Meaning and units | What it does not establish |
|---|---|---|
| `context` | Declared viewport pixels, feedback frames/second, scalar input ranges | Actual device or input trajectory |
| `flashing.records` | Component brightness delta, RGB-infinity-norm change/second, periodic cycles/second and conditional event schedules | Visible strobe timing or whole-image contrast |
| `motion.contributions` | Conditional viewport-unit/second envelopes, audio partial response, backward-sampling and forward-transport distinctions | Typical optical flow or actual trajectories from displacement alone |
| `prominence.by_component` | Clipped support, opacity, final difference gain and displayed contribution intervals | Guaranteed dominance, visible contrast or accumulated feedback coverage |
| `colour.components` | Source RGB/HSV anchors, hue-family possibilities, conditional final palette and contribution weights | A measured palette or a unique image |
| `classification` | Known-source potential index, conservative interval, overlapping candidate and eligible preference bands | Calibrated human mood accuracy |

`classification.predicted_bands` uses the known component potential estimate.
Unknown contributing activity suppresses Chill suggestions even provisionally;
zero-valued partial components do not supply a calm point estimate.
`classification.eligible_bands` additionally requires complete bounded evidence;
unknown contributing activity or execution/domain gaps veto eligibility. Consumers
must not automatically classify a provisional Chill candidate as safe/calm. The
source-potential value is not a measured mean, maximum frame intensity or p95.

## Preference assumptions

The initial policy `static-activity-preference-v1` uses references of0.75 viewport
units/second for motion,1 RGB unit/second for brightness change,0.30 RGB units for
flash contrast and2 cycles/second for flash frequency. These are editable future
preference assumptions, not a human-fitted classifier. The overlapping bands remain
Chill1–30,Normal25–75,Intense70–100. Stronger partial evidence can support an intense
candidate; missing effects cannot certify absence of flashing.

Brightness deltas for materials already contain alpha. Their screen weighting uses
support and final difference gain, without multiplying alpha a second time. Motion
uses opacity-weighted displayed contribution. Tiny, offscreen, transparent and
disconnected effects have separate controls. Feedback can grow or redistribute a
source contribution, so an initial small support is not a lifetime ceiling.

The colour producer joins shape centre/perimeter/border colours, wave colours and
qualified transfer rules. It preserves unknown inherited feedback/image colours.
Hue candidates and encoded-RGB temperature tags describe possible ingredients;
they do not prove a warm/cold or psychedelic overall appearance.

## Reproducible reference and cohort

The default reference is1920×1080 at30 feedback frames/second. A caller may supply
`--behaviour-context context.json` with `viewport`, `feedback_fps`, optional named
`reference_profile` and finite `scalar_input_domains`. These values participate in
cache identity. No context silently changes the authored shader/audio engine.

`static_behaviour_validate.py` runs an unchanged source inventory against frozen
source-bound offline compiler records and one immutable reader per worker. Optional
`--symbolic-python` and `--proof-python` enter reusable SymPy/Z3 worker sessions.
The manifest freezes model, source, reader, context, compiler-record and component
identities. Compressed per-preset rows retain errors and partial evidence. Counts
of useful descriptors or provisional bands are coverage, not appearance accuracy.

Independent producers retain their own partial results when another producer
exhausts its bounded traversal. Producer failures are exported and veto automatic
eligibility. Separate bounded caches prevent one failure from poisoning other
component calculations.

The new builder is still being qualified. See the task plan and saved cohort
results for current checkpoints; a synthetic constant-colour control passing does
not certify general feedback presets.

## Material changes when a texture sample holds fixed

A textured shape fill can now export
`flashing.records[].fixed_unit_texture_material_partial`. This bounds changes in
vertex colour and alpha when the sampled RGBA, geometry, barycentric location and
destination remain fixed. Each texture channel is a declared unit-interval input.
The calculation reuses the existing native-channel, stable-modulo and blend
calculus; over blending includes the destination term from changing alpha.

This is a partial response, not the total displayed change.
`sampling_coordinate_response_included` stays false,
`texture_history_change_rate` stays null and `total_brightness_rate_known` stays
false. Missing texture bindings remain unverified. A positive ceiling does not
prove that a flash occurs. These fields do not alter automatic mood eligibility.

The frozen809-preset descriptor recheck recovers finite partial rates for592 and
finite two-state contrast bounds for643;28 and97 have positive ceilings. Inputs
and exact source hashes are retained in the task evidence. This does not certify
809 full native visuals or replace the unknown texture/history contribution.

Motion evidence retains caller `scalar_input_domains` and reference-profile
identity. Geometry time/audio partials and uniform native transport envelopes
use the union of declared context domains and validated input-scenario domains;
a conflicting interval for the same scalar name is rejected with the same policy
as prominence. Declared amplitude intervals still supply no audio change rate.
The effective domain map and its hash are exported separately from caller context
and scenario identity.

## Final-output storage and finite shader domains

The default declared home-TV reference uses `output_storage: normalized-unorm`,
matching the app's RGB888 surface choice. Set `output_storage: unknown` for a
consumer whose output storage is not established; that context cannot qualify
automatic activity bands. The storage policy participates in cache identity.

`displayed_output` preserves raw channel intervals and separately applies the
normalized output clamp. Temporal RGB entirely above1 can become constant white;
RGB entirely below0 can become constant black. Raw modulation records remain
unchanged. Partially clipped RGB retains its remaining contrast. A nominal clamp
result alone is insufficient to qualify calm behaviour.

The bounded `native_finite_guard` checks a restricted declared binary32 model:
constants, declared scalar inputs, basic arithmetic, constant casts and finite
sin/cos. It propagates outward enclosures and includes possible subnormal flushing.
Unknown inputs, unsupported operations, overflowing intermediates or exhausted
work remain unresolved. The shader clock domain must be declared with its actual
source input name (for example `_c2.x`); no clock range is silently invented.
Native-model output bounds must also remain consistent with the nominal bounds
within the stated5%width+1e-6 allowance. This rejects tight nominal formulas whose
loss of significance permits much wider native-model values.

These guards retain source assumptions and do not certify driver transcendental
precision or rendered pixels. Repeated overlapping shapes and possible borders
also retain their aggregate local influence when a composite resamples them;
source-area integrals cannot replace that per-texel bound.

## Conditional potential and editable preferences

The scorer now consumes the separate fixed-texture material partial in
`classification.partial_contributions`. It can inform the known-source potential
index after spatial support and final transfer are accounted for. Its lower bound
never becomes total activity, and excluded texture/history trajectories keep
automatic eligibility unresolved. Tiny, invisible and unknown-transfer controls
remain guarded. A source response ceiling can be canceled by other effects; it is
not a guaranteed visible reaction.

A declared behaviour context may include `activity_preferences`, an object of
finite validated overrides for the references in `classification.preference_rules`.
For example `{"motion_reference_vp_s":1.5}` changes the preference mapping while
leaving the underlying physical evidence unchanged. The resolved rules participate
in export/cache identity; unknown names, nonfinite values and invalid thresholds
reject. Bands stay Chill1–30,Normal25–75,Intense70–100.

The first derived scoring-only check on the frozen2000 v5 records retains367
indices and changes0. Its1305 fixed-texture partial records are exported but their
final transfers remain too uncertain to provide additional whole-display values.
This is a bottleneck result, not a classification improvement claim. Original
rows remain unchanged and the derived results have a distinct scorer/source hash.
